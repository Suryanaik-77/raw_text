Answer:

designs, and it allows you to apply the best possible set of timing-centric variables or 
commands during compile for critical delay optimization as well as QoR improvements.
The following list highlights compile_ultra  command features that are in addition to 
the features listed in 
The compile Command. Note that some features require additional 
licensing.
• DesignWare components
A DesignWare library is a collection of reusable circuit-design building blocks 
(components) that are tightly integrated into the Synopsys synthesis environment. 
When you use the compile_ultra  command, Design Compiler selects the component 
with the best speed and area optimization from the DesignWare library during 
synthesis. For more information, see 
DesignWare Libraries.

The compile_ultra Command
Use the compile_ultra  command for designs that have significantly tight timing 
constraints. The command is the best solution for timing-critical, high performance 
designs, and it allows you to apply the best possible set of timing-centric variables or 
commands during compile for critical delay optimization as well as QoR improvements.

To compile a design, you use the compile  command in DC Expert or the compile_ultra 
command in DC Ultra or DC Graphical. Command options allow you to customize and 
control optimization. When you compile a design, Design Compiler reads the HDL source 
code and optimizes the design created from that description. The tool uses heuristics 
to implement a combination of library cells that meets the functional, speed, and area 
requirements of the design according to the attributes and constraints placed on it. The

This capability characterizes your target logic library and creates a pseudolibrary called 
ALIB, which has mappings from Boolean functional circuits to actual gates from the 
target library. The ALIB file provides Design Compiler with greater flexibility and a 
larger solution space to explore tradeoffs between area and delay during optimization.

• Automatic ungrouping
The compile_ultra  command automatically ungroups certain logical hierarchies. 
Ungrouping merges subdesigns of a given level of the hierarchy into the parent cell
