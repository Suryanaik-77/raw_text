2. QUESTION:
I am reading hvt library as part of synthesis, I want to avoid few cells usage during synthesis, what is the command which I can use to avoid usage of few library cells?

ANSWER:
To prevent the use of specific library cells during synthesis, use the set_dont_use command with the appropriate library and cell names. For example:

set_dont_use hvt_lib/CELL_NAME

3. QUESTION:
I dont want to delete unloaded sequential cells during optimization in synthesis in design compiler, what is the app_var I need to use and to what value I need to set it

ANSWER:
To prevent deletion of unloaded sequential cells during optimization in synthesis in Design Compiler, set the app_var compile_delete_unloaded_sequential_cells to false.

========================================================================================================================

4. QUESTION:
I dont want to delete constant sequential cells during optimization in synthesis in design compiler, what is the app_var I need to use and to what value I need to set it

ANSWER:
To prevent deletion of constant sequential cells during optimization in Design Compiler, use the set_constant_register_removal command and set its value to false.

7. QUESTION:
what data does report_qor report have in design_compiler

ANSWER:
The report_qor command in Design Compiler provides the following data:

- Timing path group details for each scenario, including:
  - Levels of logic
  - Critical path length
  - Critical path slack
  - Critical path clock period
  - Total negative slack
  - Number of violating paths
  - Worst hold violation
  - Total hold violation
  - Number of hold violations
- Cell count information, including the number of macros in the design
- Design statistics such as:
  - Combinational area
  - Noncombinational area
  - Total area
- Static power
- Design rule violations
- Compile time details, including the wall clock time of the last compile command

The report_qor command displays these quality of results (QoR) metrics for the current design and is not part of the create_qor_snapshot and query_qor_snapshot command set.

10. QUESTION:
what does spg option do in compile_ultra command

ANSWER:
The -spg option in the compile_ultra command enables physical guidance technology, which provides enhanced placement, allows seed placement information to be passed to IC Compiler for improved quality of results, correlation, and routability, reduces routing congestion during synthesis, enables automatic layer optimization, and supports floorplan creation and modification through floorplan exploration. It also activates buffer-aware placement and timing-driven placement with an approximate timing model, and enables port punching for better load balancing and quality of results.
