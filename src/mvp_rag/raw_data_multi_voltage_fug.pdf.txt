Low-Power Design Strategies
Power consumption is becoming an increasingly important aspect of circuit design. This 
chapter introduces power reduction strategies in the following sections:
•
Increasing Challenges of Power
• Dynamic and Static Power
• Power Reduction Methods
• IEEE 1801 Standard (UPF)
Increasing Challenges of Power
Device densities and clock frequencies have increased dramatically in CMOS devices, 
thereby increasing power. At the same time, supply voltages and transistor threshold 
voltages have been lowered, causing leakage current to become significant.
High power consumption can result in excessively high temperatures during operation, 
reducing reliability because of electromigration and other heat-related failure mechanisms. 
High power consumption also reduces battery life in portable devices.
Energy is used to power millions of computers, servers, and other devices, both to run 
the devices and to cool the machines and buildings in which they are used. Even a small 
reduction in power consumption can result in large aggregate cost savings to users and 
significant benefits to the environment.
Dynamic and Static Power
Designers consider two types of power consumption, dynamic and static. Dynamic power 
is consumed during the switching of transistors, so it depends on the clock frequency and 
switching activity. Static power is the transistor leakage current that flows whenever power 
is applied to the device, so it is not related to switching activity.
The most advanced synthesis and physical implementation tools consider total power 
– the sum of dynamic and static leakage power – as well as physical placement 
optimization. Total power optimization shortens critical nets and cell sizing to optimize 
power within the allowed timing margins.

Dynamic Power
Dynamic power is the energy used during logic transitions on nets, consisting of switching 
power and internal power. Switching power results from the charging and discharging of 
the external capacitive load on the cell output. Internal power results from the short-circuit 
(crowbar) current that flows through the PMOS-NMOS stack during a transition.
Switching power is illustrated in 
Figure 1. A transition from 0 to 1 on the inverter output 
charges the capacitive load through the PMOS transistor. A transition from 1 to 0 
discharges the same capacitive load through the NMOS transistor.
Figure 1 Switching Power
The energy used in each transition depends on the supply voltage and the capacitive load. 
Also, because the current flows only during logic transitions, the long-term dynamic power 
depends on the clock frequency and switching activity.
Internal power occurs when the input is at an intermediate voltage level, when both the 
PMOS and NMOS transistors are conducting. This condition results in a nearly short-
circuit conductive path from VSS to ground, as illustrated in 
Figure 2. A relatively large 
current, called the crowbar current, flows through the transistors briefly. Higher threshold 
voltages and slower transitions result in more internal power.

Static (Leakage) Power
With shrinking device geometries and reduced threshold voltages, leakage power is 
becoming more significant. Sub-threshold leakage, reverse-bias p-n junction diode 
leakage, and gate leakage all contribute to total leakage, as shown in 
Figure 3.
Figure 3 Static Leakage Currents
Sub-threshold leakage is the small source-to-drain current that flows even when the 
transistor is held in the “off” state. With lower power supply voltages and lower threshold 
voltages, “off” gate voltages are close to “on” threshold voltages. Sub-threshold leakage 
current increases exponentially as the gate voltage approaches the threshold voltage.

Chapter 1: Low-Power Design Strategies
Power Reduction Methods
Feedback
Leakage at reverse-biased p-n junctions (diode leakage) occurs from the n-type drain of 
the NMOS transistor to the grounded p-type substrate, and from the n-well (held at VDD) 
to the p-type drain of the PMOS transistor. This leakage is relatively small.
Gate leakage is the result of using an extremely thin insulating layer between the gate and 
channel of the MOS transistor. Quantum-effect tunneling of electrons through the gate 
oxide can occur, resulting in leakage from the gate to the source or drain.
Leakage currents occur whenever power is applied to the transistor, irrespective of the 
clock frequency or switching activity, but they can be reduced or eliminated by lowering the 
supply voltage or by switching off the power supply.
Power Reduction Methods
There are several different RTL and gate-level design strategies for reducing power. Some 
methods, such as clock gating, have been used widely and successfully for many years. 
Others, such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, have not been used much due 
to the difficulty of implementing them. As power becomes increasingly important, more 
methods are being exploited.
Supply Voltage Reduction
The most basic way to reduce power is to reduce the supply voltage. Power is proportional 
to the square of the supply voltage, for both dynamic and static power. Successive 
generations of CMOS technologies have used lower and lower supply voltages.
Each lowering of the supply voltage reduces per-gate power consumption, but also lowers 
the switching speed. In addition, the transistor threshold voltage must be lowered, causing 
more problems with noise immunity, crowbar currents, and sub-threshold leakage.
Clock Gating
Clock gating is a dynamic power reduction method that stops the clock signals for selected 
register banks during periods of inactivity. One simple implementation of clock gating is 
shown in 
Figure 4.

Figure 4 Simple Clock Gating
Clock gating is useful for registers that need to maintain the same logic values over many 
clock cycles. The main challenges are finding the best places to use it and creating the 
logic to shut off and turn on the clock at the proper times.
Synthesis tools such as Power Compiler can detect low-throughput datapaths where 
clock gating can give the greatest benefit and automatically insert clock-gating cells at the 
appropriate locations. Clock gating is relatively simple to implement because no additional 
power supplies or power infrastructure changes are needed.
Figure 5  shows an example of sequential, latch-based clock-gating cell and the related 
waveforms.

The clock input to the register bank, ENCLK, is gated on or off by the AND gate. ENL is 
the enabling signal that controls the gating; it is derived from the EN signal of the clock 
gating control logic. The register bank is triggered by the rising edge of the ENCLK signal. 
Clock gating eliminates the need to reload the same value in the register through multiple 
clock cycles, thereby saving power.
Clock gating reduces clock network power dissipation, relaxes datapath timing, and 
reduces routing congestion by eliminating feedback multiplexer loops. For designs that 
have large register banks, clock gating can save power and area by reducing the number 
of gates in the design.
Another clock gating technique is self-gating, shown in 
Figure 6. In this example, an XOR 
gate compares the data stored in the register with the data arriving at the data pin of the 
register. The XOR output controls the enable condition for gating. If the data is unchanged, 
the unnecessary clock cycles are gated by the output of the XOR gate.

D Q
Self-gating is useful when the enable condition cannot be inferred from the existing logic. 
It can be applied across multiple registers to create an combined enable condition for the 
register bank.
Multiple-Vt Library Cells
Some CMOS technologies have multiple cells operating at different threshold voltages (Vt 
values) for the same logic function. A low-Vt cell has better speed but higher sub-threshold 
leakage current.
The synthesis tool can choose the appropriate type of cell to use based on the tradeoff 
between speed and power. It uses low-Vt cells in the timing-critical paths for speed and 
high-Vt cells everywhere else for lower leakage power.
Multivoltage Design
Different parts of a chip might have different speed requirements. For example, the CPU 
and RAM blocks might need to be faster than a peripheral block. To get maximum speed 
where needed and also minimize power, the CPU and RAM can operate with a higher

supply voltage while the peripheral block operates with a lower voltage, as shown in 
Figure 7.
Figure 7 Multivoltage Chip Design
Providing multiple supply voltages on a single chip introduces some complexities and 
costs. Additional device pins must be available to supply the chip voltages, and the power 
grid must distribute each of the voltage supplies separately to the appropriate blocks.
Where a logic signal leaves one power domain and enters another, if the voltages are 
significantly different, a level-shifter cell is necessary to generate a signal with the proper 
voltage swing. In the example shown in 
Figure 8, a level shifter converts a signal with 1.8-
volt swing to a signal with a 1.0-volt swing. A level-shifter cell itself requires two power 
supplies that match the input and output supply voltages.

Power Switching
Power switching is a power-saving technique that shuts down parts of the device during 
periods of inactivity. In a mobile phone chip, the block that performs voice processing can 
be shut down when the phone is in standby mode. The voice processing block must “wake 
up” from its powered-down state when needed.
Power switching has the potential to reduce overall power consumption substantially 
because it lowers leakage power as well as switching power. It also introduces some 
additional challenges:
• Power controller – A logic block that determines when to power down and power up a 
specific block. There is some time and power cost for powering down and powering up 
a block, so the controller must determine the appropriate power-down times.
• Power switching network – A large number of high-Vt transistors with source-to-drain 
connections between the always-on power supply rail and the power pins of the cells. 
The power switches are distributed physically around or within the block. The network, 
when switched on, connects the power to the logic gates in the block.
• Isolation cells – Cells inserted in the design where signals leave a powered-down block 
and enter a block that is powered up. An isolation cell provides a known, constant 
logic value to an always-on block when the power-down block has no power, thereby 
preventing unknown or intermediate values that could cause crowbar currents.
• Retention registers – Registers that retain data during power-down by saving the data 
into a shadow register (also known as the bubble register). Upon power-up, the device 
restores the data from the shadow register to the main register.

Power Switch Implementation
Power switches are implemented with high-Vt transistors because they minimize leakage 
and their speed is not critical. PMOS header switches can be placed between VDD and 
the block power supply pins, or NMOS footer switches can be placed between VSS and 
the block ground pins, as shown in 
Figure 9. The number, drive strength, and placement 
of switches should be chosen to give in an acceptable voltage drop during peak power 
usage.
Figure 9 Power-Switching Network Transistors
The switching strategy shown in Figure 9  is called a coarse-grain strategy because the 
power switching is applied to the whole block. Multiple transistors in parallel drive a 
common supply net for the block. In a fine-grain strategy, each library cell has its own 
power switch, allowing fine-grain control over which cells are powered down. The fine-
grain approach has better potential for power savings, but requires significantly more area.
Power switching can be combined with multivoltage operation. Different blocks can 
be designed to operate at different voltages and also to be separately powered down 
when they are not needed. In that case, the interface cells between different blocks must 
perform both level shifting and isolation functions, depending on whether the two blocks 
are operating at different voltages or one is shut down. A cell that performs both functions 
is called an enable level shifter. This cell must have two separate power supplies, just like 
any other level shifter.
Isolation Implementation
One simple implementation of an isolation cell is shown in 
Figure 10. When the block on 
the left is powered up, the signal P_UP is high and the output signal passes through the 
isolation cell unchanged (except for a gate delay). When the block on the left is powered 
down, P_UP is low, holding the signal constant at logic 0 going into the always-on block.

Other types of isolation cells can hold a logic 1 rather than 0, or can hold the signal value 
latched at the time of the power-down event. Isolation cells must themselves have power 
during block power-down periods.
Figure 10 Isolation Cell
Retention Cell Implementation
When a block is powered down and then powered back up, it is often desirable for the 
block to be restored to the state it was in before the power-down event. There are several 
strategies for doing this. For example, the block register contents can be copied to RAM 
outside of the block before power-down, and then copied back after power-up.
Another strategy is to use retention registers in the power-down block. One type of 
retention register implementation is shown in 
Figure 11. The SAVE signal saves the 
register data into the shadow register before power-down and the RESTORE signal 
restores the data after power-up. Instead of using separate, edge-sensitive SAVE and 
RESTORE signals, a retention register could use a single level-sensitive control signal.

Feedback
A retention register occupies a larger area than an ordinary register, and it requires an 
always-on power supply connection for the shadow register in addition to the power-down 
supply used by the rest of the device. However, restoring the data to the registers after 
power-up is fast and simple compared with other strategies.
Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling
The principle of multivoltage operation can be extended to allow the voltage to be changed 
during operation of the chip to match the current workload. For example, a math processor 
chip might operate at a lower voltage and clock frequency during simple spreadsheet 
computations, and then at a higher voltage and clock frequency during 3-D image 
rendering. The changing of supply voltage and operating frequency to meet workload 
requirements is called dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.
The chip and voltage supply can be designed to use a number of established levels, or 
even a continuous range. Dynamic voltage scaling requires a multilevel power supply 
and a logic block to determine the best voltage level to use for a given task. Design, 
implementation, verification, and testing of the device can be challenging because of 
the ranges and combinations of voltage levels and operating frequencies that must be 
analyzed.
Power-Optimized IP Components
IP collections such as Synopsys DesignWare®  minPower components are available to 
automatically implement datapath architectures that minimize high-activity datapaths 
and suppress glitches. This reduces both dynamic and leakage power for complex 
combinational logic such as that used in multipliers and digital signal processors.
Based on the actual switching activity, transition probabilities, available standard cells, 
and analysis of possible configurations, the synthesis tool automatically configures the 
IP component architectures to implement the optimal structure with the lowest power 
consumption. The IP components include blocks that incorporate low-power design 
techniques such as enhanced clock gating, built-in datapath gating, and data-tracking 
pipeline management technology.
Multibit Register Synthesis and Implementation
Synthesis and physical implementation tools group individual register bits into multibit 
registers, allowing a single clock input to drive multiple register bits. This reduces the need 
for clock tree resources such as buffers and wire, thereby reducing both power and area. 
The multibit cell itself is more efficient by sharing logic, power supply connections, and 
transistor wells for the individual bits.

To get the best possible power savings during multibit synthesis, provide accurate

registers according to switching activity so that total power is minimized.
IEEE 1801 Standard (UPF)
The IEEE 1801 Standard for Design and Verification of Low Power Integrated Circuits, 
also known as the Unified Power Format (UPF), consists of a set of commands used to 
specify the power intent for multivoltage electronic systems. Using UPF commands, you 
can specify the supply network, power switches, isolation, retention, and other aspects 
of power management for a chip design. A single set of low-power design specification 
commands is used throughout the design, analysis, verification, and implementation flow.
Synopsys tools support the UPF infrastructure and commands. Usage of the UPF 
commands throughout the multivoltage flow is the main focus of this book. The term 
“multivoltage” is intended to include multisupply designs (those with shut-down power 
domains), even when the multiple domains operate at the same voltage.

Library Requirements
In order to use power-saving strategies such as clock gating, multivoltage, multiple-Vt 
library cells, or power switching, the library must contain logic cells that support these 
strategies. Some of the types of cells that support low-voltage design are described in the 
following sections:
•
Liberty PG Pin Syntax
• Clock-Gating Cells
• Multiple Threshold-Voltage Cells
• Level-Shifter Cells
• Isolation Cells
• Power-Switch Cells
• Always-On Logic Cells
• Retention Register Cells
• Macro Cells With Internally Generated Power
• Converting Libraries to PG Pin Library Format
Liberty PG Pin Syntax
In earlier generations of CMOS technologies, all devices on a chip were connected to 
a single, chip-wide power supply at all times. Logic libraries did not contain information 
about power supply connections of cells because all cells shared the same types of 
connections to VDD and VSS.
However, with the increasing use of multiple power supplies on a chip, it has become 
necessary to specify which power supplies can be connected to specific power pins 
of each cell. For some types of cells such as level shifters, specifying different power 
supplies for different power pins of the same cell has become necessary.
To accommodate this type of information, the Liberty library syntax was expanded to 
support the specification of power rail connections to the power supply pins of cells. This 
power and ground (PG) pin information allows synthesis, implementation, and verification

tools to optimize the design for power, to properly connect the cells in layout, and to 
analyze the design behavior where multiple supply voltages are being used.
For more information on the PG pin syntax and the modeling of power supply pin 
connections, see Advanced Low-Power Modeling  in the Library Compiler™ User Guide  in 
the 
Library Compiler Online Documentation.
For an older library that does not have PG pins, you can quickly add PG pins with the 
add_pg_pin_to_lib  or add_pg_pin_to_db  command in Design Compiler or IC Compiler, 
thereby making the library compatible with the UPF power specification. Alternatively, you 
can use the update_lib_model  command to update the library using FRAM models or the 
update_lib_voltage_model, update_lib_pg_pin_model, and update_lib_pin_model 
commands to provide the PG pin information. For details, see 
Converting Libraries to PG 
Pin Library Format.
Clock-Gating Cells
Synthesis tools such as Power Compiler can determine where clock gating can be used 
to provide the greatest power-saving benefit, and can automatically insert clock-gating 
circuits into the design to implement the clock-gating functions.
Inserting clock-gating circuitry into an existing clock network can introduce skew that 
adversely affects timing. To have the synthesis tool account for such effects during 
synthesis, you can have the tool use predefined integrated clock-gating cells, which can 
be provided as logic cells in the library. An integrated clock-gating cell integrates the 
various combinational and sequential elements of a clock gate into a single library cell. 
Figure 12  shows one possible implementation of an integrated clock-gating cell.

A clock-gating cell can incorporate any kind of logic such as multiple enable inputs, 
test clock input, global scan input, asynchronous reset latch, active-low enabling logic, 
or inverted gated clock output. Power Compiler is free to optimize the enabling logic

Library Compiler Online Documentation

Multiple Threshold-Voltage Cells
Multiple threshold voltage libraries support two or more different threshold-voltage 
groups for each logic gate. The threshold voltage determines the delay and leakage 
characteristics of the logic cell. Cells with lower threshold voltages can switch more quickly 
but have higher leakage. Cells with higher threshold value have less leakage but a longer 
switching delay.
Liberty library syntax supports cells of different threshold voltages in the same library using 
the default_threshold_voltage_group  attribute. This attribute defined at the library 
level specifies the name of the category to which a cell belongs, based on the voltage 
characteristics of the cell. This attribute has the following syntax:
default_threshold_voltage_group : "group_name";
The following example shows the usage of the default_threshold_voltage_group

Defining Multiple Threshold-Voltage Cells Using Attributes
If your target library does not define multiple threshold-voltage cells and the associated 
attributes, you can use the set_attribute  command in the tool to define multiple 
threshold-voltage cells.
The following Design Compiler script example shows how you set the library-level 
default_threshold_voltage_group  attribute to the high_vt_library and low_vt_library 
library files, which contain cells of the high and low threshold-voltage groups respectively 
in separate library files.
set HVT_lib "high_vt_library"
set LVT_lib "low_vt_library"
set_attribute [get_libs $HVT_lib] -type string \
   default_threshold_voltage_group HVT
set_attribute [get_libs $LVT_lib] -type string \
   default_threshold_voltage_group LVT
If you have multiple threshold-voltage cells in the same library file, you can set the 
default_threshold_voltage_group  and threshold_voltage_group  attributes as 
shown in the following example:
set all_vt_lib "multiple_vt_lib"
set_attribute [get_libs $all_vt_lib] -type string \
   default_threshold_voltage_group HVt
set_attribute [get_lib_cells ${all_vt_lib}/FAST*] -type string \
   threshold_voltage_group LVt
set_attribute [get_lib_cells ${all_vt_lib}/MEM*] -type string \
   threshold_voltage_group MD
To set the multithreshold voltage constraint in the Design Compiler or IC Compiler tool, 
use the set_multi_vth_constraint  command, or in the IC Compiler II or Fusion 
Compiler tool, use the set_max_lvth_percentage  command. For details, see the man 
page for the command.
Level-Shifter Cells
In a multivoltage design, a level shifter is required where each signal crosses from one 
power domain to another. The level shifter operates as a buffer with one supply voltage at 
the input and a different supply voltage at the output. Thus, a level shifter converts a logic 
signal from one voltage swing to another, with a goal of having the smallest possible delay 
from input to output. See 
Figure 13.

The library description of a level-shifter cell must have information about the type of 
conversion performed (high-to-low, low-to-high, or both), the supported voltage levels, and 
the identities of the respective power pins that must be connected to each power supply.
Synopsys synthesis and implementation tools can identify nets in the design that require 
adjustment between the driver and receiver, find appropriate level-shifter cells in the 
available libraries, insert the level shifters into the netlist, place the level shifters, and route 
the required logic connections and respective power supplies.

Isolation Cells
In a design with power switching, an isolation cell is required where each logic signal 
crosses from a power domain that can be powered down to a domain that is not powered 
down. The cell operates as a buffer when the input and output sides of the cell are both 
powered up, but provides a constant output signal during times that the input side is 
powered down. An enable input controls the operating mode of the cell. See 
Figure 14.

Power-Switch Cells
In a design with power switching, either header or footer type power switch cells are 
required to supply power for cells that can be powered down. A header type power switch 
connects the power rail to the power supply pins of the cells in the power-down domain. A 
footer type power switch connects the ground rail to the ground supply pins of the cells in 
the power-down domain. An input logic signal to the power switch controls the connection 
or disconnection state of the switch. See 
Figure 16.
Figure 16 Power-Switch Cells
The library description of a power-switch cell specifies the input signal that controls 
power switching, the pin or pins connected to the real power rail, and the pin or pins that 
provide the virtual (switchable) power. The power-switch cell can optionally have an output 
“acknowledge” signal indicating the current status of the switch.

Always-On Logic Cells
When dealing with shutdown domains, there can be some situations in which certain 
cells in the shutdown portion need to continuously stay active, such as for implementing 
retention registers, isolation cells, retention control paths, and isolation enable paths. 
For example, if a save signal or restore signal passing through a shutdown voltage 
area needs buffering, an always-on buffer cell must be used. This type of logic is called 
always-on logic, which is built with always-on library cells. Compared to an ordinary 
cell, a functionally equivalent always-on cell has a backup power supply that operates 
continuously, even during the shutdown mode. See

Retention Register Cells
In a design with power switching, there are several different ways to save register states 
before power-down and restore them upon power-up in the power-down domain. One 
method is to use retention registers, which are registers that can maintain their state 
during power-down by means of a low-leakage register network and an always-on power 
supply.
The library description of a retention register specifies the power pins and the input signals 
that control the saving and restoring of data. It also specifies which power pins are normal 
and can be powered down and which ones are the always-on pins used to maintain the 
data during power-down. See

Macro Cells With Internally Generated Power
A macro cell can contain a voltage converter subcircuit that supplies power to other 
subcells within the macro cell at a voltage different from the supply voltage provided to the 
macro cell itself. The internally generated supply can be represented by an internal PG 
pin.
Synopsys synthesis and implementation tools support macro cells with internal PG pins. 
These macro cells have the following attribute settings in the PG pin definition in the 
library:
• The direction  attribute is internal.
• The pg_type  attribute is internal_power.
• The pg_function  attribute is set to the name of the macro cell supply from which the 
internal voltage converter generates the internal voltage.
• The switch_cell_type  attribute is not defined; the macro cell uses the generated 
supply voltage internally and does not make it available as an output.

Modeling  in the Library Compiler™ User Guide  in the

Documentation.

Power Intent Specification
The IEEE 1801 Standard for the design and verification of low-power integrated circuits, 
also known as the Unified Power Format (UPF), provides a consistent way to specify 
power implementation intent throughout the design process, including synthesis, physical 
implementation, and verification. This consistency makes it easier to perform synthesis, 
simulation, logical equivalence checking, and design verification in the presence of specific 
low-power features in a given design.
Specifying the power intent of a design in the Synopsys flow is described in the following 
sections:
•
IEEE 1801 Standard (UPF)
• Power Intent Concepts
• Power Network Examples
• UPF Commands Supported by Synopsys Tools
• UPF Command Tracking

IEEE 1801 Standard (UPF)
The IEEE 1801 Standard for Design and Verification of Low Power Integrated Circuits, 
also known as the Unified Power Format (UPF), consists of a set of Tcl-like commands 
used to specify the design intent for multivoltage electronic systems. Using UPF 
commands, you can specify the supply network, switches, isolation, retention, and 
other aspects of power management for a chip design. A single set of low-power design 
specification commands can be used throughout the design, analysis, verification, and 
implementation flow.
Synopsys tools are designed to follow the IEEE 1801 (UPF) standard approved by the 
IEEE Standards Association. This standard is supported by a large number of EDA 
companies, including Synopsys. Detailed information about the standard can be found 
in the IEEE 1801 specification itself, available as a download from the IEEE Standards 
Association at http://standards.ieee.org.

Synopsys tools support a large subset of the commands in the IEEE 1801 (UPF) standard.
In addition, they support some UPF-like power intent commands that are not part of the
standard.
Wildcard Pattern Matching in UPF Commands
The IEEE 1801 LRM states that wildcard pattern matching is only allowed in the
find objects and upf_query commands. However, Synopsys tools provide wildcard
matching for many UPF commands to improve usability.
Wildcard pattern matching uses the following special operators:
? matches any single character, except the hierarchical separator "/"
* matches any sequence of zero or more characters, except the hierarchical separator.
All UPF commands that perform pattern-based object lookup support the "?" and "*"
wildcards, and the object lookups occur in the current scope. Table 1 shows some
examples of wildcard matching.

The UPF language establishes a set of commands to specify the low-power design
intent for electronic systems. Using UPF commands, you can specify the supply network,
switches, isolation, retention, and other aspects relevant to power management of a
chip design. The same set of low-power design specification commands is to be used
throughout the design, analysis, verification, and implementation flow. Synopsys tools are
designed to follow the official IEEE 1801 UPF standard.
The UPF language provides a way to specify the power requirements of a design, but
without specifying explicitly how those requirements are implemented. The language
specifies how to create a power supply network for each design element, the behavior
of supply nets with respect to each other, and how the logic functionality is extended to

support dynamic power switching to design elements. It does not contain any placement or 
routing information.
In the UPF language, a power domain  is a group of elements in the design that share a 
common set of power supply needs. By default, all logic elements in a power domain use 
the same primary supply and primary ground. Other power supplies can be defined for a 
power domain as well. A power domain is typically implemented as a contiguous voltage 
area  in the physical chip layout, although this is not a requirement of the language.
Each power domain has a scope  and an extent. The scope  is the level of logic hierarchy 
designated as the root of the domain. The extent  is the set of logic elements that belong to 
the power domain and share the same power supply needs. The scope is the hierarchical 
level at which the domain is defined and is an ancestor of the elements belonging to the 
power domain, whereas the extent is the actual set of elements belonging to the power 
domain.
Each scope in the design has supply nets  and supply ports  at the defined hierarchical 
level of the scope. A supply net  is a conductor that carries a supply voltage or ground 
throughout a given power domain. A supply net that spans more than one power domain is 
said to be “reused” in multiple domains. A supply port  is a power supply connection point 
between two adjacent levels of the design hierarchy, between the parent and child blocks 
of the hierarchy. A supply net that crosses from one level of the design hierarchy to the 
next passes through a supply port.
A supply set  is an abstract collection of supply nets, consisting of two supply functions, 
power and ground. A supply set is domain-independent, which means that the power and 
ground in the supply set are available to be used by any power domain defined within the 
scope where the supply set was created. However, each power domain can be restricted 
to limit its usage of supply sets within that power domain.
You can use supply sets to define power intent at the RTL level, so you can synthesize 
a design even before you know the names of the actual supply nets. A supply set is an 
abstraction of the supply nets and supply ports needed to power a design. Before such a 
design can physically implemented (placed and routed), its supply sets must be refined, or 
associated with actual supply nets.
A supply set handle  is an abstract supply set created for a power domain. By default, 
a power domain has supply set handles for the domain’s primary supply set, a default 
isolation supply set, and a default retention supply set. These supply set handles let you 
synthesize a design even before you create any supply sets, supply nets, and supply ports 
for the power domain. Before such a design can be physically implemented, its supply 
set handles must be refined, or associated with actual supply sets; and those supply sets 
must be refined so that they are associated with actual supply nets.
A power switch  (or simply switch) is a device that turns on and turns off power for a supply 
net. A switch has an input supply net, an output supply net that can be switched on or off, 
and at least one input signal to control switching. The switch can optionally have multiple

lists the allowed combinations of voltage values and states of the power switches for all

A level shifter  must be present where a logic signal leaves one power domain and enters 
another at a substantially different supply voltage. The level shifter converts a signal from 
the voltage swing of the first domain to that of the second domain.
An isolation  cell must be present where a logic signal leaves a switchable power domain 
and enters a different power domain. The level shifter generates a known logic value 
during shutdown of the domain. If the voltage levels of the two domains are substantially 
different, the interface cell must be able to perform both level shifting (when the domain 
is powered up) and isolation (when the domain is powered down). A cell that can perform 
both functions is called an enable level shifter.
In a power domain that has power switching, any registers that must retain data during 
shutdown must be implemented as retention registers. A retention register has a separate, 
always-on supply net, sometimes called the backup supply, which keeps the data stable in 
the retention register while the primary supply of the domain is shut down.
Power Network Examples
The power network example shown in Figure 21  demonstrates some of the power intent 
concepts. This chip is designed to operate with three power supplies that are always on 
(although the UPF syntax also supports externally switchable power supplies), at three 
different voltage levels. The top-level chip occupies the top-level power domain, PD_TOP. 
The domain PD_TOP is defined to have four supply ports: VDD1, VDD2, VDD3, and GND. 
The black squares along the border of the power domain represent the supply ports of that 
domain. Note that this diagram shows the connections between power domains and is not 
meant to represent the physical layout of the chip.

Figure 21 Power Intent Specification Example
In addition to the top-level power domain, PD_TOP, there are three more power domains 
defined, called PD1, PD2, and PD3, created at the levels of three hierarchical blocks, 
Block1, Block2, and Block3, respectively. Each block has supply ports (shown as black 
squares in the diagram) to allow supply nets to cross from the top level down into the block 
level.
In this example, PD_TOP, PD2, and PD3 are always-on power domains that operate at 
different supply voltages, VDD1, VDD2, and VDD3, respectively. PD1 is a power domain 
that has two supplies: a switchable supply called VDD1g and an always-on supply from 
VDD1. The always-on power supply maintains the domain’s retention registers while 
VDD1g is powered down.
A power switch shuts off and turns on the power net VDD1g, either by connecting or 
disconnecting VDD1 and VDD1g. A power-down controller logic block at the top level 
generates the control signal for the switch. It also generates the save and restore signals 
for the retention registers in domain PD1 and the control signals for the isolation cells

between domain PD1 and the always-on domains PD2 and PD3. These isolation cells 
generate known signals during times that VDD1g is powered down.
Because domains PD1, PD2, and PD3 operate at different supply voltages, a level shifter 
must be present where a signal leaves one of these domains and enters another. In the 
case of the signals leaving PD1 and entering PD2 or PD3, the interface cells must be able 
to perform both level shifting and isolation functions, because PD1 can be powered down.
To access a particular power domain, supply port, or supply net in the design hierarchy, 
you specify the hierarchical path in the design to the scope where the object exists, and 
end with the object name; or you can change the scope of the tool to that hierarchical level 
and specify the object name directly. For example, suppose you want to create a supply 
net called VDD1 and a supply port called PRT1 at the scope of Block1, which is in power 
domain PD1, and you want to make a connection from the net to the port within the scope 
of Block1. From the scope of the top level (the default scope), you could use the following 
commands:
create_supply_net VDD1 -domain Block1/PD1
create_supply_port PRT1 -domain Block1/PD1
connect_supply_net Block1/VDD1 -ports {Block1/PRT1}
An alternative command entry method is to change the scope to Block1 using either the 
set_scope  or current_instance  command and using simple (not hierarchical) names in 
the commands:
set_scope Block1
create_supply_net VDD1 -domain PD1
create_supply_port PRT1 -domain PD1
connect_supply_net VDD1 -ports {PRT1}
set_scope ...
In the foregoing power intent strategy, each hierarchical block is assigned to its own power 
domain. It is also possible for a hierarchical block to belong to the same power domain as 
its parent or for multiple hierarchical blocks to belong to a single power domain.
In the alternative power intent specification shown in 
Figure 22, Block2 and Block3 share 
the same power characteristics, so they are assigned to a single power domain called 
PD2, created at the top level of hierarchy. The two blocks can use the supply nets defined 
at the top level, so it is not necessary to create the supply ports explicitly between the 
lower-level blocks and the current level of hierarchy.

Figure 22 Alternative Power Intent Specification
The scope (hierarchical level) of power domain PD1 is the block Block1, whereas the 
scope of power domain PD2 is the top level. Block1 uses the supply nets within the scope 
of Block1, whereas Block2 and Block3 use the supply nets within the scope of the top 
level. The supply net VDD1 crosses from the top level of the design down to the level 
of Block1, so it must pass through a supply port defined at the scope of Block1, and the 
supply net is said to be reused in domain PD1. The supply net VDD2 is defined at the top 
level, in power domain PD_TOP, but it is also used in power domain PD2, so it is said to 
be reused in PD2. A reused supply net spans different domains and has the same name in 
these domains.
To define the power domain strategy shown in the first example (
Figure 21), you would use 
the following commands:
create_power_domain PD_TOP
create_power_domain PD1 -elements {Block1} -scope Block1
create_power_domain PD2 -elements {Block2} -scope Block2
create_power_domain PD3 -elements {Block3} -scope Block3

UPF Commands Supported by Synopsys Tools
Feedback
To define the power domain strategy shown in the second exampe1 (Figure 22), with 
Block1 and Block2 in the same domain, you would use the following commands:
create_power_domain PD_TOP
create_power_domain PD1 -elements {Block1} -scope Block1
create_power_domain PD2 -elements {Block2 Block3}
or equivalently:
create_power_domain PD_TOP
set_scope Block1
create_power_domain PD1
set_scope ...
create_power_domain PD2 -elements {Block2 Block3}
Even if Block2 and Block3 share the same power supply characteristics, you might want to 
place them in separate power domains anyway. Doing so would cause the synthesis and 
implementation tools to implement the power supply connections to the blocks separately. 
For example, if the blocks are placed in power-down domains, the physical implementation 
tool might use larger or faster switching cells to provide power to the block that draws a 
larger current.
Bidirectional signals cannot be isolated or level-shifted. If any bidirectional signals require 
isolation or level shifting at a power domain boundary, modify the design to separate those 
signals into distinct input signals and output signals.
UPF Commands Supported by Synopsys Tools
Synopsys tools currently support a large subset of the commands in the IEEE 1801 (UPF) 
standard. In addition, they support some UPF-like power intent commands that are not 
part of the official standard.
Certain UPF commands are supported by some Synopsys tools but not others. For 
example, the synthesis and physical implementation tools generate new UPF commands, 
so they support the save_upf  command, whereas the static timing and verification tools 
do not generate any UPF commands, so they do not support the save_upf  command.
See the following SolvNetPlus article for the complete list of UPF commands supported by 
the following tools: Design Compiler (Power Compiler), Fusion Compiler, IC Compiler II, 
RTL Architect, Formality, PrimeTime, PrimePower, VCS, and VC LP:

UPF Command Tracking
Feedback
UPF Command Tracking
Synthesis and physical implementation tools often perform changes that affect the UPF 
infrastructure of the design, such as inserting power management cells. These changes 
affect the UPF commands written out by the save_upf  command. It is often desirable to 
see the original commands in the context of the new commands generated by the tool and 
written by the save_upf  command.
The Design Compiler, IC Compiler, IC Compiler II, and Fusion Compiler tools offer two 
modes for maintaining the set of UPF commands for a design:
• UPF-prime mode – The tool writes out a new UPF file, called the UPF-prime file 
(Design Compiler) or UPF-double-prime file (IC Compiler), which contains a mixture of 
old, modified, and new UPF commands.
• Golden UPF mode – The tool writes out a “supplemental” UPF file containing only 
the UPF commands that changed the design. The original “golden” UPF file and 
supplemental file together specify the power infrastructure of the design.
UPF Command Tracking in Design Compiler and IC Compiler
In the UPF-prime mode, the Design Compiler and IC Compiler tools read in a UPF script 
file and then later write out a modified UPF script file containing the original commands 
plus new UPF commands that it executes to carry out its power management tasks. The 
generated UPF script can then be passed on to downstream tools in the flow.
To make it easier to compare and track user-written UPF commands in the flow, the 
Design Compiler and IC Compiler tools maintain the original UPF commands separately 
from the tool-inserted UPF commands. The user-written commands and tool-inserted 
commands are written to separate sections in the output UPF script file. This feature is 
called UPF tracking. If you do not need the tracking feature and would prefer that the tool 
keep closely related commands together in the file, set the mv_upf_tracking  variable to 
false. For more information, see the man page for the variable.
UPF tracking is not supported in hierarchical flows. Therefore, if you use commands 
such as characterize  or propagate_constraints -power_supply_data , the 
mv_upf_tracking  variable is automatically set to false, causing closely related 
command to be written out together in the output UPF file, and mixing the user-written and 
tool-inserted commands.
UPF Command Tracking in IC Compiler II and Fusion Compiler
In the IC Compiler II and Fusion Compiler tools, UPF commands that you enter during 
the session are automatically stored and preserved in the database. The tool keeps track 
of any changes it makes to your entered UPF commands. When you write out the UPF

with the save_upf  command, the tool writes out each of your entered commands as a 
comment line, immediately followed by the tool-modified command.
Golden UPF Flow
The golden UPF flow is an optional method of maintaining the UPF multivoltage power 
intent of the design. It uses the original “golden” UPF file throughout the synthesis, 
physical implementation, and verification steps, along with supplemental UPF files 
generated by the synthesis and physical implementation tools.
Figure 23  compares the traditional UPF-prime flow with the golden UPF flow.

Chapter 3: Power Intent Specification
Golden UPF Flow
Feedback
The golden UPF flow maintains and uses the same, original “golden” UPF file throughout 
the flow. The synthesis and physical implementation tools write power intent changes 
into a separate “supplemental” UPF file. Downstream tools and verification tools use a 
combination of the golden UPF file and the supplemental UPF file, instead of a single UPF’ 
or UPF’’ file.
The golden UPF flow offers the following advantages:
• The golden UPF file remains unchanged throughout the flow, which keeps the form, 
structure, comment lines, and wildcard naming used in the UPF file as originally 
written.
• You can use tool-specific conditional statements to perform different tasks in different 
tools. Such statements are lost in the traditional UPF-prime flow.
• Changes to the power intent are easily tracked in the supplemental UPF file.
• You can optionally use the Verilog netlist to store all PG connectivity information, 
making connect_supply_net  commands unnecessary in the UPF files. This can 
significantly simplify and reduce the overall size of the UPF files.
In the Design Compiler, IC Compiler, IC Compiler II, and Fusion Compiler tools, the UPF-
prime mode is enabled by default. To use the golden UPF flow, you must enable it. In the 
Design Compiler or IC Compiler tool:
prompt> set_app_var enable_golden_upf true
In the IC Compiler II or Fusion Compiler tool:
prompt> set_app_options -name mv.upf.enable_golden_upf -value true
After you enable this mode, to execute any UPF commands other than query commands, 
you must put the commands into a script and execute them with the load_upf  command. 
You cannot execute them individually on the command line or with the source  command.
For more information about using the golden UPF mode, see 
SolvNetPlus article 1412864, 
“Golden UPF Flow Application Note.”

Synopsys Multivoltage Flow
The Synopsys multivoltage synthesis, implementation, and verification flow is shown in 
Figure 24. The flow starts with the register-transfer level (RTL) description of the logic of 
the design, together with a separate UPF description of the power intent of the design. The 
RTL and UPF descriptions are contained in separate files so that they can be maintained 
and modified separately. The initial UPF description is designated the UPF0 file in this 
example.
Figure 24 Multivoltage Flow With Synopsys Tools
The Design Compiler tool reads in the RTL logic and original UPF power intent 
descriptions, and based on their contents, synthesizes a gate-level netlist and an updated 
UPF file, designated UPF’ (UPF prime) in this example. The UPF’ file contains the original 
UPF information plus explicit supply net connections for special cells created during 
synthesis.
The IC Compiler, IC Compiler II, or Fusion Compiler tool reads in the gate-level netlist 
and UPF’ power description files, and based on the file contents, performs physical 
implementation (placement and routing), producing a modified gate-level netlist, a 
complete power and ground (PG) netlist, and an updated UPF file, UPF’ ’ (UPF double-

prime). The UPF’ ’ file contains the UPF’ information plus any modifications to low-power 
circuit structures resulting from physical implementation, such a power switches.
The data files used in this flow can be used for functional verification with the VCS 
simulator, formal equivalence checking with the Formality tool, and timing and power 
verification with PrimeTime, PrimePower, and PrimeRail tools.
The VCS NLP multivoltage simulation tool can be used for functional verification of the 
design with multivoltage features at several different stages of the flow: at the RTL level 
before synthesis, at the gate level after synthesis with power-related cells added, and after 
placement and routing with the power switches added. At each level, VCS NLP simulates 
the design to verify the impact of voltage changes in a power-managed chip, allowing you 
to accurately and reliably detect any low-power design issues. The VC LP tool checks for 
adherence to multivoltage rules and reports any problems related to power connectivity, 
power architecture, or power intent consistency.
The PrimeTime tool reads the gate-level netlist from the synthesis or physical 
implementation tool and also reads the UPF descriptions generated by those tools. It uses 
the UPF information to build a virtual model of the power network and to annotate voltage 
values appropriately on each power pin of each leaf-level gate instance in the design. 
The PrimeTime tool does not modify the power domain description in any structural or 
functional way, so it does not write out any UPF commands.

The simple multivoltage chip design shown in Figure 25  has two power supplies, VDD1 
and VDD2, at different voltage levels. The chip has two internal blocks, CPU_1 and 
CPU_2, both of which are instances of the same CPU block. Block CPU_1 and the 
top level of the chip use VDD1, whereas block CPU_2 uses VDD2. Both VDD1 and 
VDD2 operate as always-on power throughout the chip. The same ground, VSS, is used 
throughout the chip.

Changes Written by the save_upf Command
After the synthesis or physical implementation tool uses the original UPF power intent 
specification, it writes out a new UPF script with the save_upf  command. The new script 
fully specifies the power intent of the design as seen from the top level. Therefore, lower-
level commands originally entered at the block level are converted into commands that 
hierarchically specify the domains, supply nets, and supply ports.

Switched Power Supply Example
The chip design shown in Figure 26  has two external power supplies, VDD_MAIN and 
VDD_PM. The chip has two internal blocks, CPU_1 and CPU_2, both of which are 
instances of the same CPU block. An on-chip voltage regulator produces two supplies, 
vrout1 and vrout2, at different voltage levels. The supply vrout1 powers the “normal” 
CPU block and the supply vrout2, at a higher voltage level, powers the “fast” CPU block. 
The VDD_MAIN power supply is switchable on the chip. Each CPU block has its own 
internal switch to turn on and turn off its own power supply. A power manager logic block 
generates the signals that control the power switches.

Power Switching States for a Macro Cell

Power Switching States for a Macro Cell
In the power intent example shown in Figure 28, the macro cell has an internal power 
switch. The rest of the circuit within the macro cell gets its power from the output of the 
internal switch. The internal power switch is controlled by a signal pin at the cell interface. 
The signal driving this macro control pin is the same as the signal controlling the power 
switch driving the rest of the design outside the macro. Furthermore, VDD and MVDD 
are always on, but with different voltages. In other words, the on/off states of supply net 
VDDS and MVDDS (which are not accessible from the design) are synchronized together, 
although they are at different voltages.
Figure 28 Macro Cell With Power Switch
The design-level power switch is not yet available in the RTL. However, a UPF script is 
needed to create this power switch and describe the supply scheme of the design, such 
that all tools recognize that no isolation cell is needed between the macro cell and the rest 
of the circuit in the design.
The macro cell vendor must provide a Liberty cell model for the macro so that all signal 
pins are related to the switched power pin of the macro. The macro cell model should look 
like 
Figure 29  schematically.

Multivoltage Verification Using VCS NLP and VC LP
In the Synopsys functional verification flow, you can use the VCS Native Low Power (NLP) 
tool for multivoltage functional simulation and the VC LP tool for static multivoltage rule 
checking. The VCS NLP tool simulates the design to verify the impact of voltage changes 
in a power-managed chip, allowing you to detect any low-power design issues accurately 
and reliably. The VC LP tool checks multivoltage rules and reports any problems related to 
power architecture, power intent consistency, and power connectivity.

VCS NLP Native Low Power Simulation
A VCS NLP simulation verifies the power management architecture, including the power-
up and power-down sequence and the policies for retention, isolation, and level shifting.
For more information, see Low Power Simulation  in the VCS Native Low Power User 
Guide  in the 
VCS Online Documentation.
Debugging Low-Power Designs Using Verdi
The VCS NLP tool has the native Verdi integrated, which can be used for debugging low-
power simulations. The Verdi tool supports IEEE 1801 UPF and allows you to visualize, 
trace, and analyze the source of low-power events. It simplifies low-power debugging 
by allowing you to visualize the power intent (UPF) and supports features to determine 
whether an unexpected design behavior is caused by the functional logic or a power 
event.
For VCS and Verdi databases to be consistent for accurate debugging, the VCS NLP tool 
instruments the low-power objects in HDL design to mimic the power intent specified in the 
UPF. The Verdi tool allows you to debug low-power objects instrumented by VCS NLP.
For more information, see Debugging Low Power Designs  in the VCS Native Low Power 
User Guide  in the 
VCS Online Documentation.
VC LP Static Low-Power Multivoltage Rule Checking
The VC LP static low-power multivoltage rule checking tool verifies that the design 
conforms to the multivoltage rules and power intent specification. The types of checking it 
performs are divided into the following categories:
• UPF consistency and power architecture – Checks the isolation and level-shifting 
policies and elements versus requirements implied by the power state table, and 
identifies missing, incorrect, and redundant isolation and level-shifting cells.
• Micro architecture – Island-order checks on control paths and clock paths in the 
design with respect to inserted power-related elements, including the following types 
of signals: isolation enable, power-gating enable, power switch acknowledge, retention

save/restore, clock reset, and scan enable. “Island ordering” refers to the always-on 
relationships between power domains that share control signals.
• Implementation versus intent – Checks the implementation versus UPF-specified intent 
for isolation, level shifting, retention, always-on synthesis, floating nets/pins, switch 
network, and PG connectivity.
For more information, see VC LP Checking  in the VC Static Platform User Guide  in the 
VC 
LP Online Help.
Design Flow Stages and Multivoltage Checking
These are the stages in the design flow at which multivoltage simulation and rule checking 
can be performed:
• Original RTL + UPF, before synthesis
• Gate-level netlist + UPF’ produced by the Design Compiler and Power Compiler tools
• Gate-level netlist + UPF” and PG netlist produced by the IC Compiler, IC Compiler II, 
and Fusion Compiler tools
The types of checking that can be performed at each stage are summarized in 
Figure 30.

Logic Synthesis Using Design Compiler
The Design Compiler tool completely supports multivoltage logic synthesis, including 
automatic insertion of level shifters, isolation cells, and retention registers based on 
UPF commands and UPF-specified power state tables. A Power Compiler license is 
required for using UPF. The topographical mode of the Design Compiler tool accurately 
predicts post-layout timing and area in synthesis, helping to eliminate design iterations 
between synthesis and layout. DFT Compiler supports the use of retention registers and 
the insertion of level shifters and isolation cells where scan chains cross power domain 
boundaries.

For synthesis, the Design Compiler tool uses the RTL description of the design logic and 
the UPF description of the design power supply. The input UPF to the Design Compiler 
tool is used for RTL simulation and formal equivalency checking, as well as for synthesis. 
After it completes synthesis, the Design Compiler tool writes out a new gate-level UPF 
description, which includes the original UPF read in, any additional UPF commands run 
in the Design Compiler session, and UPF commands that describe the explicit supply 
connections to the multivoltage power management cells added during synthesis (isolation 
cells, level shifters, and retention registers). The UPF description generated by the Design 
Compiler tool can be used by compatible tools.
To synthesize a design with UPF power intent, the top-down flow is the most 
straightforward. These are the general steps in the flow:
1. Read the RTL file.
2. Use the load_upf  command to read the UPF file.
3. Specify the timing and power constraints.
4. Compile the design using the compile_ultra  command.
5. Insert the scan chains using the insert_dft  command.
6. Use the save_upf  command to save the updated constraints into a new UPF file, 
which can be used as input to downstream tools.
7. Write the synthesis netlist into a file, which can be used as input to downstream tools.
When you use the save_upf  command, the Design Compiler tool writes out UPF 
commands in the same order that they were read in with the load_upf  command, and 
it writes the user-entered and tool-inserted UPF commands into a separate section. 
This feature makes it easier to track UPF changes by maintaining the command order 
of the original UPF script. However, this feature applies only to top-down synthesis; in 
a hierarchical synthesis flow, the save_upf  command changes the ordering of the UPF 
commands.
Top-down synthesis is the simplest approach because you can compile the entire 
multivoltage design by running the compile command at the top level. For a large design, if 
necessary, synthesis can also be done using a bottom-up approach.

Power Domains and Hierarchy
Power domains defined for the design determine the connections of power nets and the 
implementation of power-down voltage areas. You can assign one or more hierarchical 
blocks to each power domain. Nested power domains are allowed if each power domain 
is contiguous and completely enclosed within a single higher-level power domain. Each 
hierarchical cell can belong to only one power domain.
For more information, see Creating Power Domains  in the Power Compiler™ User Guide 
in the 
Synthesis Online Help.
Specifying Operating Voltages
You can specify operating voltages of supply nets in the design with the set_voltage 
command. Parts of the design powered by these supply nets are timed and optimized 
based on the cell properties at the specified voltages. Process and temperature values are 
determined by the top-level operating condition.
For more information, see Multivoltage Design Flow Using UPF  in the Power Compiler™ 
User Guide  in the 
Synthesis Online Help.
Isolation, Level Shifter, and Retention Register Insertion
The Design Compiler tool automatically inserts isolation cells, level shifters, and retention 
registers during a compile operation. It uses the strategies set with UPF commands 
set_isolation, set_isolation_control, set_level_shifter, and so on, together 
with the power state table created by the commands create_pst  and add_pst_state. 
The voltages set with the set_voltage  command must be consistent with the voltages 
specified in the power state table.
For more information, see Specifying Isolation Strategies, Specifying Level-Shifter 
Strategies, Specifying Retention Strategies, and Specifying Repeater Strategies  in the 
Power Compiler™ User Guide  in the

Always-On Synthesis
The cells of a shutdown block that are on a control signal path must remain active during 
the powered-down phase. These signals include power-down/power-up control signals 
and retention register save signals.

Always-on synthesis is performed by inserting buffers and inverters along the control 
signal paths using either of the following types of cells:
• Standard, single-power cells that are placed in special always-on site rows within the 
shutdown block’s voltage area
• Special-purpose, dual-power cells that are marked as always-on
For more information, see Always-On Logic  in the Power Compiler™ User Guide  in the 
Synthesis Online Help.
Compile
Compile performs logic synthesis for the design, taking into consideration the multiple 
voltages and multiple power domains defined by UPF commands. Compile makes sure 
that the logic inside each power domain is mapped to technology cells from the correct 
voltage corner.
Design Compiler topographical mode completely supports all multivoltage features. The 
create_voltage_area  command creates a voltage area for placing the cells associated 
with a particular power domain, like the same command in the IC Compiler, IC Compiler 
II, or Fusion Compiler tool. This command completes the physical constraints linked to the 
multivoltage design.
Note:
The compile_ultra  command, the default synthesis command in the Design 
Compiler topographical mode, automatically ungroups all design hierarchies 
to achieve better timing results. However, the logic hierarchies associated with 
power domains are not ungrouped and the power domain boundary information 
is therefore preserved.
Apart from the regular optimization, the compilation takes care of specific optimization and 
synthesis operations relating to level shifter, isolation, and retention cells.
Compile automatically inserts buffer-type level shifters on the appropriate nets and purges 
all redundant level shifters. By default, it does not insert level shifters on clock nets. To 
change this behavior, set the auto_insert_level_shifters_on_clocks  variable to a list 
of clock names or to all  before running compile.
Retention register inference and control port hookup operations are performed by compile. 
Compile maps user-specified registers in the shutdown power domain with retention 
registers. Compile synthesizes applicable registers with retention registers and hooks 
up the save and restore pins to control ports. Library retention cells should have specific 
attributes at the cell and pin levels to identify the retention cell and the “save” and “restore” 
control pins.

If you want to insert power management cells outside of a compile operation, you can do 
so with the insert_mv_cells  command. This command inserts isolation, level-shifter, and 
enable level-shifter cells based on the UPF definition, without doing a full compile.
Multivoltage Checking
It is important to check the design signal consistency across power domains. There are 
some features that can change the hierarchical ports of the logic netlist, and if those ports 
are defined at the power domain interface, then new isolation cells or level shifters might 
be needed.
For more information on analyzing and reporting multivoltage aspects of a design, see 
Examining and Debugging UPF Specifications  and Reporting Commands for the UPF 
Flow  in the Power Compiler™ User Guide  in the 
Synthesis Online Help.
DFT Methodology Using DFT Compiler
If a scan chain crosses power domain boundaries, additional level shifters and isolation 
cells are required on the scan path to take care of voltage shifting and isolation 
requirements. This affects design timing and area quality of results. Therefore, the most 
common requirement for multivoltage DFT methodology is to make sure scan insertion 
is bounded by the power domains. When it is necessary for two or more power domains 
share the same scan chain, the number of domain crossing points should be minimized.
When you run DFT Compiler in the Design Compiler tool, any necessary multivoltage 
special cells (level shifters and isolation cells) are automatically inserted according to 
the strategies specified by UPF commands. The insertion strategy specifies the types of 
level shifters or isolation cells that are needed when a scan path crosses a power domain 
boundary and the locations where these cells are inserted.

TestMAX

Logic Synthesis Using Fusion Compiler
The Fusion Compiler tool takes a design all the way from RTL to GDS. The Fusion 
Compiler compile_fusion  command performs RTL synthesis and placement including 
mapping- and area-based optimization followed by logic-based delay optimization, 
placement and buffer-tree creation, and physical optimization for timing, power, and area. 
After compile_fusion, you execute the commands for clock tree synthesis (CTS) and 
post-CTS optimization, routing and post-route optimization, and signoff timing closure. 
The compile_fusion  command unifies next generation synthesis and the placement and 
optimization steps of the IC Compiler II tool.

In the Fusion Compiler synthesis flow for multivoltage designs, the compile_fusion 
command is used to insert mapped power management cells and perform an always-
on synthesis. For detailed information on the flow diagram and the steps in the flow, see 
Multivoltage Design Overview  in the Fusion Compiler™ Multivoltage User Guide  in the 
Fusion Compiler Online Help.
The Fusion Compiler tool supports both the traditional UPF flow and the golden UPF flow.
In the traditional flow, also known as the UPF prime (UPF') flow, the RTL file containing the 
design intent and the UPF file containing the power intent are both read in by the Fusion 
Compiler tool. During synthesis, the tool might insert special cells such as isolation or 
level-shifter cells into the design to fulfill the UPF power intent. When logic synthesis is 
complete, the tool writes out a gated netlist and a UPF prime (UPF') file. The UPF' file 
contains any changes to the power intent that occurred during synthesis. The UPF' file is a 
mixture of original UPF commands and new or modified commands.
The golden UPF flow maintains and uses the original UPF file throughout the flow. The 
Fusion Compiler tool writes power intent changes into a separate supplemental UPF file. 
Downstream tools and verification tools then use the combination of the golden UPF file 
and the supplemental UPF file. For detailed information on the two UPF flows and their 
comparison, see UPF Flows  in the Fusion Compiler™ Multivoltage User Guide  in the 
Fusion Compiler Online Help.
Design Planning Using IC Compiler II or Fusion Compiler
You can use the IC Compiler II or the Fusion Compiler physical implementation tools for 
the design planning of flat physical designs. This includes basic floorplanning capabilities 
such as design initialization, power planning, and fast placement of standard cells and 
macros.
Design planning for multivoltage designs involves some additional considerations. The 
major floorplanning tasks in multivoltage designs are creating voltage areas, routing 
multiple supply nets, inserting multiple-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) power switch cells, 
and analyzing the supply network.

Power Domains and Voltage Areas
It is important to include UPF-specified power domain and supply net objects in the 
physical implementation phase. When implementing multivoltage designs, these objects 
are required to create voltage areas, to derive interface net constraints, and to perform 
specific optimizations.
Power domains and voltage areas should maintain a one-to-one mapping relationship. A 
power domain and its matching voltage area should have the same name and same set of 
hierarchical cells. When a power domain is mapped with the voltage area, the associated 
logic information is automatically derived from power domain.
Physically nested voltage areas are supported as long as the inner voltage area is 
completely contained within the outer voltage area. A nested voltage area corresponds 
to a logically nested power domain. Voltage areas that would overlap physically must be 
resolved into nonoverlapping, abutted rectangular or rectilinear subareas.
The floorplan is the first design stage where the voltage area can be defined. If you cannot 
identify the best location for a voltage area, you can run a quick placement and trace the 
voltage-area-related logic to determine a suitable location. On the other hand, if you know 
an ideal location for a voltage area, you can specify its coordinates explicitly.
Both rectangular and rectilinear shapes are supported for voltage areas. The specified 
voltage area is the physical placement area for the logic belonging to the corresponding 
power domain. Except for level shifters, all cells associated with a voltage area operate at 
the same process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) operating condition values.
The IC Compiler II tool can automatically create power straps and rings for the voltage 
areas. Starting from reliability constraints, power network synthesis automatically 
generates power supply routing for certain design regions, such as voltage areas. In 
addition, power network analysis provides voltage drop and electromigration information.
For more information on creating voltage areas and assigning cells belonging to a specific 
power domain to the voltage area, see:

Power Management Cell Placement
Power-related cells such as level shifters, isolation cells, retention registers, always-on 
cells, and power switches typically have multiple power and ground pins and are taller

than standard cells. As a designer, you need to make sure that all the power pins are 
connected and correctly routed to the power nets.
For example, consider the low-to-high level-shifter cell with two power pins shown in 
Figure 31. The cell is taller than a standard cell and has 2X height.
Figure 31 Level Shifter With Dual Power Pins
The secondary power pin, VDDL, should be connected to the power supply net VDD2. For 
power supply routing, VDDL needs to be routed to the VDD2 strap. However, this cannot 
be achieved with the normal signal or power routing method. A special type of routing, 
called net mode routing (specified with the command preroute_standard_cells -mode 
net), is required to connect the secondary pin to the nearby power strap.
The layout of the special cell in 
Figure 31  is a simple and effective form. The dual height 
and power-pin layout of the cell allows the special cell to be freely placed along with the 
standard cells in core area. The timing-driven, congestion-driven placement automatically 
takes care of placing the cell properly.
On the other hand, level shifter or isolation cells might have more complex structures. 
A possible way to accommodate these special cells in the floorplan is to place them by 
themselves in a dedicated area. However, degraded quality of results can be expected 
due to the imposed placement restriction. 
Figure 32  shows an example of what separate 
level-shifter placement areas might look like.

Power switch cells require special placement near the power straps. The 
create_power_switch_array  command is used to insert and place the switch 
cells automatically on the specified insertion grid. After placing the switch cells, the 
sleep net, which connects all the sleep pins of switch cells, is connected by using the 
connect_power_switch  command.

Another aspect of design planning is the selection of the always-on cell strategy. If always-
on cells with dual power pins are used for always-on synthesis, these cells can be placed 
along with standard cells. However, if normal buffers (with a single power supply) are used 
in always-on paths, you need to make sure that the cells in the always-on path are pulled 
into a specific placement area which has constant power supply. This type of special 
placement area for always-on cells is called an exclusive move bound. A move bound can 
be defined as exclusive bound and assigned with the always-on cells.

Power Planning
After you complete the design planning process and have a complete floorplan, you can

A design with power gating requires a network of power-switching cells distributed 
physically around or within each power-down block. This network consists of PMOS 
header switches between VDD and the block power supply pins or NMOS footer switches 
between VSS and the block ground pins.

Reference Library Setup
The IC Compiler II and Fusion Compiler tools need to have always-on buffers and 
inverters available in the reference libraries. If the usage of these library cells is 
restricted by the set_lib_cell_purpose  command, the usage purpose must include 
optimization  and cts  so that the cells can be used for optimization and clock tree 
synthesis.
The purpose settings are stored in the lib_cell attributes called valid_purposes, 
included_purposes, and excluded_purposes. Another lib_cell attribute, always_on, must 
be true for always-on library cells. You can query the attributes of a library cell using the 
report_attributes -class lib_cell  command.
In the IC Compiler II or Fusion Compiler tool, to query the attributes of cell instances 
in the design, you can take advantage of the cascaded attributes feature. You can use 
any collection-type attribute to query an attribute of that collection class. For example, 
all instances have a ref_block attribute, which can be used to access the lib_cell class 
attributes of the instance.

Loading UPF Constraints
Loading UPF constraints for a design consists of two steps:
1. load_upf  – Loads the UPF commands into memory
2. commit_upf  – Applies the complete, finalized UPF commands to the current block
You can load multiple UPF files in memory before you commit them. The commit_upf 
command performs global checks for UPF consistency; resolves PG conflicts among the 
netlist, floorplan, and UPF specification; and associates power strategies with existing 
multivoltage cells. It also tries to resolve any conflicts between the power intent specified 
in the UPF file and the actual power and ground nets in the design.
Only a very limited subset of UPF commands are allowed to be used after the commit_upf 
command. If you need to make significant changes to the UPF infrastructure of the design, 
you need to use the reset_upf  command and start over with the load_upf  command.
The UPF files can contain only standard Tcl and UPF commands. Synopsys Tcl collections 
(created by get_cells, get_pins, and so on) are not allowed in UPF files. However, you 
can assign Tcl collections to Tcl variables before you load UPF, and use the Tcl variables 
inside the UPF file as needed.
Checking the Power Intent
Checking the multivoltage-related infrastructure with the check_mv_design  command is 
recommended after commit_upf, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing steps of the 
flow. The check_mv_design  command performs a complete check of UPF intent and PG 
connectivity for the block and generates a detailed report on any violations found.
The check_mv_design  command checks the following power-related issues:
• The UPF has been committed.
• HighConn and LowConn connections on lower-domain boundaries are correct and 
consistent with the PG supplies.
• Each net has a driver, and each pin has an associated and connected supply.
• The cross-domain paths have the power management functions (isolation and level 
shifting) required by the power state table.
• Unnecessary redundant power management cells have been optimized out of the 
design.
• The enable signals of isolation cells and enable level shifters are connected and driven 
by cells with appropriate always-on functionality.
• Switch cells and tie-off pins are correctly connected.

Existing Power Management Cells
The IC Compiler II and Fusion Compiler tools automatically preserve the existing power 
management cells in the design: level shifters, isolation cells, enable level shifters, 
power switches, and retention registers. The ability to correctly associate existing power 
management cells with the UPF strategy is a key part of preventing multivoltage violations 
during physical optimization.
The IC Compiler II and Fusion Compiler tools dynamically maintain the multivoltage logic 
to allow maximum flexibility during logic optimization and clock tree synthesis. The tool 
performs automatic association by tracing the logic that crosses power domain boundaries 
after usage of the commit_upf, create_mv_cells, and associate_mv_cells  commands.
Automatic association fails if the defined strategy in UPF does not completely match the 
implementation. You can debug association failures by using the following command:
prompt> report_mv_path -cell cell_instance_name
After a power management cell has been associated by the commit_upf  or 
create_mv_cells  command, the cell has an attribute called preregistration which is set to 
the name of the associated strategy.
You can force an association by a cell and a power management strategy by using the 
set_power_strategy_attribute  command. However, you should do this only if you 
understand the reason for the failure of automatic association and you want to override the 
default association.
Inserting New Power Management Cells
You can insert additional level shifters, enable level shifters, and isolation cells by 
using the create_mv_cells  command in accordance with the power strategies 
defined in the UPF. To determine the power strategies for a power domain, use the 
get_power_strategies  command.
You must introduce level shifters and isolation cells as early as possible in the design flow 
to ensure accurate timing of critical paths and to avoid unexpected timing problems later 
during the flow. You can perform optimization and clock tree synthesis only on nets that 
are free from multivoltage violations.
Level shifter strategies are required where signals cross from one domain to another at 
different supply voltages. The tool can insert new level shifters only when a valid strategy 
has been defined. If level shifter strategies are missing in the UPF, you can generate 
a generic level shifter strategy by using the create_mv_cells -generate_strategy 
level_shifter  command.

Before you insert level shifters based on the UPF strategies, be sure that the level shifter 
cells are available in the reference libraries and the voltages have been set for all supplies 
at each operating corner.
You can search for level shifter library cells with the get_lib_cells -filter  command.
To set the voltage for an operating corner, use the set_voltage  command.
To limit the choice of level shifter library cells used, define the level shifter mapping by 
using the map_level_shifter_cell  command in the UPF file for each strategy. To apply 
voltage thresholds limits for level shifter insertion, use the set_level_shifter  command 
with the -threshold  option.
After you define and apply the strategies and constraints, use the following command to 
insert the level shifters into the design:
prompt> create_mv_cells -level_shifter
...
When the tool inserts a level shifter, it sets the dont_touch  attribute on the net between 
the port and the level shifter.
To insert an enable level shifter, ensure than an isolation cell is inserted. If there is a 
voltage difference between the two domains, the tool’s optimization automatically converts 
the isolation cell into an enable level shifter.
The core commands of the tool, place_opt, clock_opt, and route_opt, consider 
multivoltage constraints as they operate. They maintain the correct power domain scope 
by adding new instances as needed during timing optimization, DRC optimization, and 
clock tree synthesis. They also fully respect physical boundaries of voltage areas for 
all instances, including the placement and legalization of power management cells. In 
general, to minimize routing lengths crossing the voltage areas, the tool places power 
management cells close to the voltage area boundaries.
Specifying UPF Constraints for Physical-Only Cells
The UPF constraints for physical-only cells can cause issues when the UPF file is read in 
to other tools that do not support physical-only cells, such as verification tools. Therefore, 
you can surround the UPF constraints for physical-only cells with the following syntax:
if {[info exists snps_handle_physical_only] && \
     $snps_handle_physical_only}
{
    connect_supply_net VDDS -ports [get_pins FILLER*/VDD]
}
By default, the snps_handle_physical_only  variable is set to true  in the IC Compiler II 
and Fusion Compiler tools. When you load and commit the UPF file, the constraints are 
applied to the physical-only cells.

Chapter 6: Tool-Specific Usage Recommendations

When you save a UPF file with the save_upf command, the tool uses the same syntax for

tool that does not have the snps_handle_physical_only variable set to true ignores
these constraints.

If you use dual-rail cells in a switched (or shutdown) power domain, the Fusion Compiler
tool should place the cells near their secondary power straps. If the dual-rail cells are
placed far away from the strap, the secondary PG routes might have too much IR drop or
electromigration.
By default, the tool assumes that the secondary PG straps are available in all regions of
a voltage area. However, to save routing resources, you might choose to have secondary

PG straps available in only a subset of the voltage area. In addition, the tool assumes that 
supplies are physically available as specified in the UPF.
Secondary PG constraints can help the tool to identify the location of straps that have 
limited physical availability, or no physical availability, in the voltage area. The tool honors 
these constraints throughout the flow. Dual-rail buffers affected by these constraints are 
placed in areas with secondary power straps. Dual-rail cells have priority over single-rail 
cells for placement in these areas.
You can specify secondary PG constraints manually. However, this effort might be difficult 
for a design with many supplies and voltage areas. Alternatively, the Fusion Compiler tool 
can evaluate the design and automatically derive basic secondary PG constraints, based

Placement and Routing Optimization
The placement, optimization, and clock tree synthesis steps in the IC Compiler II and 
Fusion Compiler tools take into account the voltage areas, power domains, always-
on logic, power state table, and power management cells protecting the power domain 
interfaces. Unlike some other tools, the IC Compiler II and Fusion Compiler tools properly 
handle always-on logic without relying on always-on attributes of cells and nets.

compatible supplies. The tool simultaneously supports two different methods of always-on 
synthesis:
• Usage of dual-rail always-on buffers, which can be placed anywhere but require 
individual routing of backup supplies to the buffers. This method is very flexible but not 
economical due to area and congestion from the backup supply routing.
• Usage of ordinary single-rail buffers, which can be placed only in special-purpose, 
always-on row sites strategically located in the voltage areas. This method is 
economical when an always-on region is available nearby.
Because the tool supports both always-on methods, it can choose the best method for 
inserting each buffer to get an optimum balance between performance and cost.
Feedthrough Buffering
The Fusion Compiler tool optimizes always-on feedthrough nets that cross voltage areas 
due to differences in the logical and physical view of the design. However, the tool inserts 
regular buffers on always-on feedthrough nets, if doing so does not introduce electrical 
violations. Inserting regular buffers instead of always-on buffers improves QoR and 
reduces congestion.
By default, the tool inserts regular buffers on always-on feedthrough nets, instead of 
always-on buffers, if the primary supply of the feedthrough voltage area is more on than 
the sink supply and the primary supply is off when the source supply is off.
A physical feedthrough net is a feedthrough net that has different physical and logical 
topologies. The tool implements physical feedthrough buffering by using dual-rail buffers to 
buffer a feedthrough net across another domain without needing to punch ports.
In some cases, the tool cannot implement physical feedthrough buffering if the power 
domain in which the buffer resides is created at a scope below the net's logical hierarchy. 
In such a case, the tool implements a logical feedthrough buffer.
For detailed information on physical and logical feedthrough buffering and how to enable 
them, see Feedthrough Buffering  in the Fusion Compiler™ Multivoltage User Guide  in the 
Fusion Compiler Online Help.
Routing
The IC Compiler II and Fusion Compiler router, Zroute, considers the multivoltage 
infrastructure and attempts to keep each route in the same voltage area and minimize the 
number of crossings over voltage area boundaries. This minimizes the need for always-on 
feedthrough connections. However, the router still creates feedthrough connections when 
the cost of detouring around a foreign voltage area is prohibitive. For example, it can be 
better to create a short feedthrough connection across a narrow foreign voltage area than 
to take a long route around it, as shown in the following figure.

Hierarchical Flow in IC Compiler II or Fusion Compiler With UPF
In the IC Compiler II or Fusion Compiler tool, hierarchical designs in all multivoltage 
UPF configurations can follow the same flow. The general handling of UPF data in the 
hierarchical flow is described in the following topics:
•
Creating Block UPF From Full-Chip UPF
• Propagating Lower-Level Block UPF Into The Top Context
• Writing Full Chip-UPF From Lower-Level Blocks With UPF
For detailed information, see the following user guides:
• IC Compiler™ II Design Planning User Guide  in the IC Compiler™ II Online Help
• Fusion Compiler™ Design Planning User Guide  in the Fusion Compiler™ Online Help
Creating Block UPF From Full-Chip UPF
In the IC Compiler II or Fusion Compiler tool, to create the UPF for a lower-level block 
from the full-chip UPF, use the split_constraints  command. This is the general 
procedure:
1. Load the full-chip netlist.
2. Load and commit the full-chip UPF.
3. Load the full-chip Synopsys design constraints (SDC).
4. Declare the lower-level blocks with the set_budget_options  -add_blocks ... 
command.
5. Run the split_constraints  command.
This automatically creates the UPF for the top-only block and each of the lower-level 
blocks, and also generates the SDC constraints for the same blocks.
Propagating Lower-Level Block UPF Into The Top Context
In the IC Compiler II or Fusion Compiler tool, block-level UPF is part of the block design 
data and is stored with the block. When you open a lower-level block with its UPF, the UPF 
is automatically loaded from the block into the top context. If you remove a lower-level 
block, the associated UPF is also removed. If you reload a modified version of the block, 
the corresponding UPF is automatically visible.

Formal Verification Using Formality
Feedback
Formal verification requires certain preparation steps with respect to libraries and the 
treatment of level shifters and isolation cells. To run the Formality tool, all related logic 
libraries must be read in, meaning all logic libraries, including level shifter libraries. 
Library cells must have power pins and power-down functions defined. Before reading 
the reference and implementation designs, .svf (the Formality guide) files created in the 
Design Compiler tool must be read by using the set_svf  command. The .svf file contains 
information used in verification to improve performance and verification success.
The Formality tool does not accept individual UPF commands entered interactively. The 
UPF description must be read in to the Formality tool with the load_upf  command. You 
can use a single, top-level load_upf  command, and for a hierarchical implementation flow, 
the top-level UPF script can contain additional load_upf  commands.
The following script reads in RTL + UPF and a synthesized netlist + UPF’ generated by the 
Design Compiler tool:
read_db {low_power_library.db special_lp_cells.db}
read_verilog -r { top.v block1.v block2.v block3.v }
set_top r:/WORK/top
load_upf -r top.upf
read_verilog -i { post_dc_netlist.v }
set_top i:/WORK/top
load_upf -i top_post_dc.upf
When you run the load_upf  command, the Formality tool checks the attributes of the 
library cells and issues warnings when the UPF file has missing or incomplete information. 
Here is an example of a summary report generated by the load_upf  command after 
checking the library:
************ Library Checking Summary ************
Warning: 54 unlinked power cell(s) with unread pg pins.
Warning: 6 linked power cell(s) with unread pg pins.
Warning: 74 unlinked power cell(s) with no power down functions on

 or latch.
Warning: 19 linked power cell(s) with no power down function on an ff or

   Use 'report_libraries -defects errors | all' for more details.
**************************************************
To ensure accurate verification, you must correct these issues before you proceed. For 
the Formality tool to automatically fix some of these defects, in the setup mode set the 
hdlin_library_autocorrect  variable to true, before reading the UPF file.
The Formality tool modifies the target reference and implementation designs to meet 
the specifications implied by the respective UPF command files. When a reference 
block is powered up, the Formality tool verifies its functionality as usual. However, when 
a reference block is powered down, the compare points of the block are considered

don’t care. The Formality tool does not allow a reference X originating in an RTL+UPF 
“off” power domain to control compare points in an “on” power domain. Failing ports 
are reported if an X leaks out of a power domain in the implementation to downstream 
compare points, thus detecting the absence or malfunctioning of a needed isolation cell.
The Formality tool recognizes and uses loaded UPF commands that create power 
domains, supply nets, supply ports, power switches, isolation cells, and retention registers. 
Because level shifters have no functional simulation effects, the Formality tool does not 
insert level shifters that perform only buffering. The Formality tool recognizes power state 
tables defined with the create_pst  command.

Formality and Formality ECO 
Online Help.

Design Data Modification With UPF
Formality modifies the target design data (reference or implementation) to meet the 
specification implied by the UPF commands. In each type of comparison, Formality verifies 
the power-up functionality and reports failing points if the implementation netlist (or netlist 
plus UPF) powers down in a manner inconsistent with the reference design plus UPF. 
During verification, when an area in the reference design is powered down, Formality 
treats the compare points in this area as don't care.
In Formality, the load_upf  command reads the file containing the UPF commands 
associated with the design data. It modifies the target design data to meet the specification 
implied by the UPF commands. As the RTL has been simulated and synthesized using 
a specific set of UPF commands, Formality must use those same commands to verify 
the RTL against the netlist. Therefore, UPF commands cannot be issued interactively in 
Formality. The load_upf  command must be used after the set_top  command after the 
design in the container has been successfully elaborated.
The load_upf  command modifies the design data by adding nets and ports as implied 
by the create_supply_net, create_supply_port, and connect_supply_net 
UPF commands. It adds ports between hierarchical levels (“port punching”) as 
needed to make the supply connections. It also adds logic to the design based 
on the create_power_switch, set_isolation/set_isolation_control, and 
set_retention/set_retention_control  UPF commands. After you execute load_upf, 
the design is modified and you can continue with the rest of the verification run.

Retention Registers
To allow formal verification of netlists synthesized from RTL, the behavior of the netlist 
must be consistent with the behavior of the RTL simulation. For any condition under which 
the RTL simulation value is not X for a register next state, primary output port, black-box 
input pin, or other compare point, the value of the matching netlist compare point must be 
identical.
In the case of the UPF set_retention  constructs, this level of consistency is not always 
possible for the following reasons:
• The Design Compiler tool chooses retention register implementations based on the 
map_retention_cell  command.
• Actual retention register implementations demonstrate more complex and varied 
behavior than the UPF syntax can specify.
In many cases, the retention behavior of synthesized netlists is not expected to match the 
simulation behavior of the RTL from which it was synthesized, and is therefore not formally 
verifiable.
To achieve consistent RTL/netlist retention behavior and enable formal verification, use 
the set_retention  and set_retention_control  commands to define the retention 
strategies. These strategy definitions must match the retention behavior of the library cell 
specified in the map_retention_cell  command.
Static Timing Analysis Using PrimeTime
The PrimeTime tool reads a gate-level netlist from the synthesis or physical 
implementation tool together with the UPF descriptions generated by those tools. It uses 
the UPF information to build a virtual model of the power network and to annotate voltage 
values on supply nets. This information allows calculation of appropriate voltage values on 
each power pin of each leaf-level gate instance in the design. You can explicitly specify the 
operating temperature of hierarchical cells. You can also override specific voltage values 
on individual power and ground pins of design cells.
PrimeTime reads and uses UPF information, but it does not modify the power domain 
description in any structural or functional way. Therefore, it does not write out any UPF 
commands with the write_script  command and there is no save_upf  command.

Voltage Scaling
The multivoltage flow can use either CCS timing or NLDM libraries. A set of CCS timing 
libraries that cover the range of voltages can be used with the voltage and temperature 
scaling capability in PrimeTime. Using NLDM libraries requires characterization at each of 
the voltages used in the design, and you set the link_path_per_instance  variable to a 
list, with each list element consisting of a list of instances and the corresponding link paths 
that override the default link path for each of those instances.
With CCS timing libraries, PrimeTime supports voltage and temperature scaling by 
interpolating between data in separate libraries that have been characterized at different 
nominal voltage and temperature values. The delay (CCS timing driver model and receiver 
model) and timing constraints are scaled. In addition, scaling occurs if there is a mixture of 
CCS and NLDM data. Scaling between the libraries is done during runtime of the tool. You 
can invoke voltage and temperature scaling by using the define_scaling_lib_group 
command. This command specifies the scaling relationships between libraries that have 
been characterized at different voltages and temperatures and invokes both delay and 
constraint scaling.
This command should be issued after the design has been read in. If the design is not 
already linked, the define_scaling_lib_group  command automatically links the design 
and creates scaling relationships between the libraries in each group. If the design is 
already linked, this command creates scaling relationships without an additional link. You 
can define multiple scaling groups to cover different portions of your design. However, 
each scaling group should contain the correct libraries for the type of scaling being 
performed (voltage, temperature, or voltage and temperature), and each library can be 
part of only one scaling group.
For more information on voltage and temperature scaling, see Cross-Library Voltage and 
Temperature Scaling  in the PrimeTime® User Guide  in the 
PrimeTime Suite Online Help.

Setting Supply Voltages and Temperature
The set_voltage  command specifies the voltage value on a supply net or PG pin of 
a cell, in volts. You can specify different minimum and maximum delay voltage values. 
You can use the -dynamic  and -min_dynamic  options to specify the dynamic portion 
of the supply voltage (the portion that can vary across successive clock cycles). The 
set_temperature  command specifies the operating temperature for a list of cells, in 
degrees Celsius. You can specify different minimum and maximum delay temperature 
values.
PrimeTime determines the cell rail voltage from the following sources of information, in 
order of increasing priority:
• voltage_map
• set_voltage  on a power net
• set_voltage  on a power pin
• Design operating condition
The voltage_map  statement in the library description of the cell (in Liberty format) 
defines the power supplies and default voltage values. The related_power_pin, 
input_signal_level, and output_signal_level  attributes in the library cell description 
specify which power supply is connected to the pin's transistor stage. The voltage signal 
level margins are defined by the input_voltage  and output_voltage  attributes in the 
library description.
On-Chip Variation Analysis
In the PrimeTime tool, the operating condition setting does not constrain the design 
linker. Note that the link is implemented before any SDC input. You can set any operating 
condition after the linking is complete. If CCS timing scaling library groups are used, 
the delay calculation is performed at the specified operating condition, if it is within the 
voltage and temperature range of the scaling group. If NLDM libraries are used, it is 
recommended to use link_path_per_instance  to assign the appropriate library to an 
instance. Operating conditions beyond the range of the scaling library group should be 
avoided. If scaling library groups are not being used, it is recommended to use a library 
characterized at the required operating condition for both NLDM and CCS libraries.

On-chip variation analysis is recommended for timing signoff. Best-case/worst-case 
analysis can produce results that are too optimistic in certain cases. In multivoltage 
designs, on-chip variation timing analysis can be performed one corner at a time using 
derate timing factors to model a slightly better or slightly worse condition around the main 
corner condition. To run this analysis, you must define a specific set of timing constraints 
to be targeted on only one corner.
When you use on-chip variation analysis, set_voltage max_case_voltage  is used for 
maximum analysis and set_voltage -min min_case_voltage  is used for minimum 
analysis. Note that with on-chip variation analysis, it is overly pessimistic to specify two 
different voltages for the same reason that it is overly pessimistic to specify two different 
best-case/worst-case operating conditions.
Reporting and Checking Multivoltage Designs
Slew scaling is applied any time a signal transits across power domains without a level 
shifter. The report_delay_calculation  command reports the slew scaling method used 
to take into account the different voltage levels between the driver and the load.
The report_power_pin_info  command is useful for reporting the power pins of cells, 
including the voltage values.
To verify the signal-level consistency on the whole design, use the check_timing 
command.
To analyze the operating condition applied to the design paths during timing analysis, it is 
only possible to check the operating conditions applied on an instance-specific basis by 
using the report_cell  command.

stores leakage currents and dynamic current waveforms. Therefore, with CCS libraries,

there is no need to characterize the library before running cell-level dynamic power and 
rail analysis. The tool reads the cell power characteristics directly from the CCS power 
library for transient power and rail analysis.
On the other hand, if NLDM libraries are used, a library should be characterized to capture 
the models of dynamic current waveforms and intrinsic parasitics using the HSPICE 
technology built in to the PrimeRail tool. While running rail analysis, the tool reads from 
these precharacterized models attached to the reference library.
To generate rail analysis maps and current waveforms, you should run a gate-level power 
analysis to generate the necessary timing and power information. For this purpose, 
PrimePower is made accessible through PrimeRail. After this step, PrimeRail reads the 
binary report of power consumption analysis to do rail analysis.
The rail analysis results can be viewed in the graphical user interface (GUI) in the form of 
a voltage drop map and waveforms. Also, you can generate reports for any voltage drop or 
current density violations.
Power-Up Inrush Current Analysis
In the coarse-grain, multiple-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) approach, power switch cells 
are used to cut off the power supply of an inactive power domain. The number of switch 
cells in the design can be large and turning them all on or off at the same time can draw 
a significant rush current from the power grid, as shown in 
Figure 36. As a designer, you 
must carefully control the power-up sequence of those power management transistors to 
minimize simultaneous switching noise when the circuits are turned.

current.

You can use PrimeRail results to optimize design parameters such as the number of
