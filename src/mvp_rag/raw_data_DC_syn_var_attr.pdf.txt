Synthesis Variables
This document describes the variables supported by the Design Compiler tool.
D
DW_lp_op_iso_mode
Specify the datapath gating style for instances of DesignWare low power components that 
have op_iso_mode parameters.
Data Types
list
Default NONE
Description
This variable specifies the datapath gating style inside a low power DesignWare 
component that has 'op_iso_mode' parameter.
By default, components that have a 'op_iso_mode' parameter have its value set to '0' 
which allows the 'DW_lp_op_iso_mode' variable to control the datapath gating style.
There are 4 possible values for DW_lp_op_iso_mode: NONE, adaptive, AND, OR. When 
the value is set to 'NONE', there is no datapath gating happing in the design; When the 
value is set to 'adaptive', preferred gating style. 'and' or 'or' depending on component 
When the value is set to 'AND', gating style is 'and'; When the value is set to 'OR', gating 
style is 'or';
Setting the 'op_iso_mode' parameter to a value other than the default value of '0' (zero) 
on an instance allows the RTL source code to override the the value set by the 
'DW_lp_op_iso_mode' variable.
The op_iso_mode parameter inside a DesignWare component has 5 possible values: 0: 
apply Design Compiler variable 'DW_lp_op_iso_mode' (default value) 1: 'none' (overrides 
'DW_lp_op_iso_mode' setting) 2: 'and' (overrides 'DW_lp_op_iso_mode' setting) 3: 
'or' (overrides 'DW_lp_op_iso_mode' setting) 4: preferred gating style. 'and' or 'or' 
depending on component (overrides 'DW_lp_op_iso_mode' setting)

M
MasterInstance
Data Types
string
Description
If a design has multiple instances, one way to resolve the multiple instances before 
compiling (when using Automated Chip Synthesis) is to select a master instance. 
Selecting a master instance is similar to using the compile-dont_touch  method of resolving 
instances. The master instance is compiled and used for all of the instances referencing 
that design.
Use the sub_designs_of  command to determine if your design contains multiple instances 
of any subdesign. Use the sub_instances_of  command to identify the multiple instances.
Use the set_attribute  command to set the MasterInstance  attribute on the instance you 
want to use as the master instance.
You can also resolve multiple instances by uniquifying or ungrouping.

Data Types
Boolean
Default true
Description
The create_block_abstraction  command processes the block, creates the 
abstraction information and annotates it on the design in memory. By default, 
create_block_abstraction  command invoke the power calculation during it's operation. 
Subsequent power reporting commands at top level can report power consumption 
correctly.
Power consumption of the block is calculated during block abstraction. The power data 
are stored as attributes on the abstract block and they are used by the report_power 
command during the final assembly step of the entire chip. Thus, the report_power 
command is able to report more accurate power consumption for the designs with abstract 
blocks.
The abstraction_enable_power_calculation  variable instructs the create_block_abstraction 
command to enable or disable the power calculation.
The abstraction_enable_power_calculation  variable is on (true) by default. If a power 
license is not available, the power calculation step is disrupted.
Setting this variable as false does not check for power license availability and power 
calculation step is not invoked.

• all_registers
attributes
Lists the predefined Synopsys attributes.
Description
Attributes are properties assigned to objects such as nets, cells, and clocks, and describe 
design features to be considered during optimization.
Attributes are grouped into the following categories:
• cell
• clock
• design
• library cell
• net
• pin
• port
• read-only
• reference
Definitions for these attributes are provided in the subsections that follow.
There are several commands used to set attributes; however, most attributes can be set 
with the set_attribute  command. If the attribute definition specifies a set command, use it 
to set the attribute. Otherwise, use the set_attribute  command.
Some attributes are informational, or read-only. You cannot set the value of these 
attributes. Most attribute groups contain read-only attributes; however, a complete list of 
these attributes is provided in the "Read Only" subsection.
Some attributes are instance-specific, which means they can be applied to specified 
objects in the design hierarchy. The following attributes are instance-specific:
• disable_timing
• load
• test_assume

Certain attributes are specific to Power Compiler objects. For information about the Power 
Compiler attributes, see the power_attributes  man page.
To determine the value of an attribute, use the get_attribute  command. To remove 
attributes, use the remove_attribute  command.
For a more detailed explanation of the attributes, see the man pages of the appropriate set 
command.
Note that path groups, cell delay, net delay, external delay, point-to-point timing 
specification, and arrival information are not represented as attributes, and therefore 
cannot be manipulated with attribute commands.
Cell Attributes
async_set_reset_q
Establishes the value (0 or 1) that should be assigned to the q output of 
an inferred register if set and reset are both active at the same time. To be 
used with the async_set_reset_qn  attribute. Use these attributes if one of the 
following condition sets apply:
• You have used the one_hot  or one_cold  attribute or directive in your HDL 
description and your logic library is written using pre-V3.0a syntax
• Your logic library does not use a consistent convention for q and qn when set 
and reset are both active
By default, if set and reset are both active at the same time, Design Compiler 
uses the convention of the selected logic library, as set with the target_library 
variable. Set this attribute with the set_attribute  command.
async_set_reset_qn
Establishes the value (0 or 1) that should be assigned to the qn output of an 
inferred register if set and reset are both active at the same time. To be used 
with the async_set_reset_q  attribute. Use these attributes if one of the following 
condition sets apply:
• You have used the one_hot  or one_cold  attribute or directive in your HDL 
description and your logic library is written using pre-V3.0a syntax
• Your logic library does not use a consistent convention for q and qn when set 
and reset are both active
If a V3.0a or later syntax logic library is used, then by default, if set and reset 
are both active at the same time, Design Compiler will use the convention of the 
selected logic library (target_library). Set with set_attribute.
If you are unsure whether or not your logic library uses V3.0a syntax, ask your 
ASIC vendor.

cells and nets in the transitive fanout of dont_touch_network  clock objects. 
The dont_touch  assignment stops at the boundary of storage elements. An 
element is recognized as storage only if it has setup or hold constraints. Set with 
set_dont_touch_network .

Description
When area_locked, the automatic wire load selection uses the initial area to do the first 
selection of the wire load model and then adjusts the wire load model down if the area 
drops. When area_reselect, the automatic wire load selection during reporting and at 
various points in compile updates the wire load model to the current area of the design. 
When false, the automatic wire load selection is off. For backwards compatibility, we also 
support the value true. True is the same as area_locked.
The automatic selection of the wire load model is used to estimate net capacitances and 
resistances from the net fanout. The wire load models are described in the technology 
library. With the automatic selection of the wire load model, if the wire load mode is 
segmented  or enclosed, the wire load model will be chosen based on the area of the 
design containing the net either partially (for segmented) or fully (for enclosed). If the wire 
load mode is top, the wire load model will be chosen based on the area of the top level 
design for all nets in the design hierarchy.
When a design's wire load model is selected manually by the user (with the command 
set_wire_load), no wire load is selected automatically for that design.
To determine the current value of this variable use printvar auto_wire_load_selection.

For example, if the tool groups two single-bit registers, a_reg[0] and a_reg[1], to one 
multibit cell, it generates the following in the output file:
create_register_bank -name a_reg[0]_a_reg[1] {a_reg[0] a_reg[1]} -lib_cell MREG2
To revert to the naming style used in previous releases, set the 
banking_enable_concatenate_name  variable to false. When the variable is false, the 
name of each register bank is created using the prefixN1_N2  format, where N1 and N2 are 
integers. The N1 and N2 integers are used so the name is unique in the output file. The 
default prefix is group.
In the previous naming style, if the tool groups two single-bit registers, a_reg[0] and 
a_reg[1], to one multibit cell, the following command is generated in the output file:
create_register_bank -name group0_0 {a_reg[0] a_reg[1]} -lib_cell MREG2
You can change the name prefix in either naming style by specifying the -name_prefix 
option of the identify_register_banks  command.
For example, if you specify the MBIT prefix with the -name_prefix  option using the 
default naming style, the output file generated during placement includes the following 
create_register_bank  command:
create_register_bank -name MBIT_a_reg[0]_a_reg[1] {a_reg[0] a_reg[1]} -lib_cell MREG2

An unused hierarchical pin is a pin of a hierarchical cell that has no drivers and no loads 
associated with it. This means that there are no leaf cells and no ports connected to the 
hierarchical pin. Nets and connections to other hierarchical pins are not accounted.
When you set this variable to true (the default), the tool ties unused hierarchical pins to 
logic 0 during compile and insert_dft, as shown in the following diagram:
+----------------------------------+
  | TOP     +------------------+     |

  |         +------------------+     |
  +----------------------------------+
For unused input pins, the constant is driven in the parent hierarchy. For unused output 
pins, the constant is driven from inside the hierarchical block.
When you set this variable to false  before linking the design, the tool leaves unused 
hierarchical pins undriven, as shown in the following diagram:
+----------------------------------+
  | TOP     +------------------+     |

The variable affects only the compile, compile_ultra, and insert_dft  commands. This 
variable does not affect design read, link, or design write commands.
Note that when you perform boundary optimization, constant propagation can result in 
unused hierarchical pins in the compiled design that were driven in the RTL. Boundary 
optimization is on by default when you use the compile_ultra  command.

bit_blasted_bus_linking_naming_styles
Specifies the bus pin naming styles to be matched.
Data Types
String
Default %s[%d] %s(%d) %s_%d_
Description
When the enable_bit_blasted_bus_linking  variable is set to true, the 
bit_blasted_bus_linking_naming_styles  variable allows the linker to recognize bit-blasted 
buses by pin names during the link process. If the pin names follow a specific pattern, DC 
Explorer infers a bus when encountering the individual blasted bits.
Typically, the RTL pin names and the logic library pin names should match. Signals are 
defined the same way in both the RTL and the library. They are defined as buses or a 
bus is defined by its individual wires. Occasionally, mismatches occur during design 
development; for example, when you transfer the design from one technology to another. 
To fix the mismatches, you can set the enable_bit_blasted_bus_linking  variable to true 
before the design is read.
Setting the enable_bit_blasted_bus_linking  variable to true allows the linker 
to match buses and bit-blasted pin names according to the patterns specified 
by the bit_blasted_bus_linking_naming_styles  variable. The default for the 
enable_bit_blasted_bus_linking  variable is false.
For example,
prompt> set bit_blasted_bus_linking_naming_styles {%s[%d] %s_%d}
This setting permits the following U1 reference to link
input [1:0] in;
my_macro U1( .S(in),...
even if my_macro is defined as follows:
my_macro
input S_1;
input S_0;
\...
For multiple-dimension buses, the style can be explicitly defined or in certain cases 
implied. For example, the %s[%d] setting matches
A[0], A[0][0], or A[0][0][0], and so on.

Description
When the enable_bit_blasted_bus_linking  variable is set to true, the linker can recognize 
bit-blasted buses by pin names during the link process. If the pin names follow a specific 
pattern, DC Explorer infers a bus when encountering the individual blasted bits. The 
bit_blasted_bus_linking_order  variable allows the user to specify the bus order.
The allowed values are {reference|ascending|descending}. when the variable value is set 
to 'ascending' or 'descending', a reconstructed 32 bit bus A would become, respectively, 
A[0:31] and A[31:0]. If the variable value is 'reference' the reconstructed bus pin order 
will follow the order found on the bit blasted reference. The variable defines the global 
behavior for all linked designs in the session.
To determine the current setting of this variable, use the printvar 
bit_blasted_bus_linking_order  command. For a list of all system variables and their current 
values, use print_variable_group system.

Data Types
Boolean

Variable is not supported in DC Explorer
Description
When set to true, this variable causes the dc_allocate_budgets  command to automatically 
generate a set_critical_range  command for any budgeted cells that have multiply-
instantiated subdesigns. The value of critical_range  is set to 10% of the shortest clock 
period in the design. If the top-level design already has a critical_range  attribute, then that 
original value is used instead.
The purpose of this is to improve QoR, since any multiple instances must be dont_touched 
after compile in a bottom-up compile flow. Using set_critical_range  causes any near-
critical paths in these blocks to be optimized before the block is dont_touched.

When set to true, this variable causes the dc_allocate_budgets -mode rtl  command to

Data Types
Boolean
Default true
Description
Affects the read  command except for the db, Verilog and VHDL formats. This variable 
is primarily used when reading in designs in the LSI/NDL format. That particular format 
does not support representation of busses, but, if port names follow a specific pattern (as 
described in the variable bus_inference_style), the individual bits can be "inferred" into a 
port bus. When true (the default value), This variable specifies that the members of that 
port bus are to be sorted in descending order rather than in ascending order.
For example, with the variable bus_inference_style  set to "%s[%d]", the ports "A[1]", 
"A[2]", "A[3]", and "A[4]" will be "inferred" into a port bus named "A". If this variable is true,

log file if multiple scenarios exist.
Data Types
string
Default ""
Description
This variable specifies the name of a log file generated during the propagation of constant 
values, from case analysis or from nets tied to logic zero or logic one. The log file contains 
the list of all ports and pins that propagate constants. The constant propagation algorithm 
is an iterative process that propagates constants through nets and cells starting from a list 
of constant pins. The algorithm finishes when no more constants can be propagated. The 
format of the log file follows the constant propagation algorithm.
In multicorner-multimode, you must specify the log file name in the definition of each 
scenario, or no log will be generated for that scenario. If you switch the active scenario, 
the log file used will be switched automatically. Log files for different scenarios can have 
the same name.
By default, this variable is set to an empty string, and no log file is generated during 
constant propagation.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar case_analysis_log_file

Determines whether case analysis is propagated through integrated clock gating cells.
Data Types
Boolean

Description
When this variable is set to false (the default), constants propagating throughout the 
design will stop propagating when an integrated clock gating cell is encountered. 
Regardless of whether the integrated clock gating cell is enabled or disabled, no logic 
values will propagate in the fanout of the cell.
When the value is true, constants propagated throughout the design will propagate 
through an integrated clock gating cell, provided the cell is enabled. An integrated clock 
gating cell is enabled when its enable pin (or test enable pin) is set to a high logic value. 
If the cell is disabled, then the disable logic value for the cell is propagated in its fanout. 
For example, for a latch_posedge ICG, when it is disabled, it will propagate a logic 0 in its 
fanout.
To activate logic propagation through all integrated clock gating cells, you must set the 
following:
set case_analysis_propagate_through_icg true

Description
The ccd_ignore_ports_for_boundary_identification  application variable specifies the 
ports to exclude when concurrent clock and data optimization (CCD) performs boundary 
identification. Typically you would specify high-fanout ports, such as scan enable and reset 
ports, to prevent large numbers of flip-flops from being identified as boundary flip-flops.
The tool performs boundary identification only when the ccd_optimize_boundary_timing 
application variable is false. If the ccd_optimize_boundary_timing  application variable 
is true, the tool ignores the setting of the ccd_ignore_ports_for_boundary_identification 
application variable.
Examples
The following examples ignore the dddi[25] and clk1 ports during boundary identification.
prompt> set ccd_ignore_ports_for_boundary_identification "dddi[25] clk1"
ccd_ignore_ports_for_boundary_identification {dddi[25] clk1}

                [list dddi[25] clk1]
ccd_ignore_ports_for_boundary_identification {{dddi[25]} clk1}
The following example ignores the input ports during boundary identification.
prompt> set ccd_ignore_ports_for_boundary_identification \\
                 [get_object_name [get_ports -filter "direction==in"]]

Description
The ccd_optimize_boundary_timing  application variable controls whether CCD performs 
optimization on boundary timing paths.
By default (true), CCD optimizes boundary timing paths. In this case, all flip-flops in 
the block are available for CCD. The tool does not perform boundary identification 
and ignores the setting of the ccd_ignore_ports_for_boundary_identification  and 
ccd_ignore_scan_reset_for_boundary_identification  application variables.
To disable optimization on boundary timing paths, such as I/O paths, set the 
ccd_optimize_boundary_timing  application variable to false. When this option is false,
• Only internal flip-flops are available for CCD
The tool performs boundary identification to differentiate between the boundary and 
internal flip-flops. If your design contains ports that connect to a large number of flip-
flops, such as scan enable and reset ports, you might want to exclude these ports from 
the boundary identification; otherwise, most of the flip-flops are considered boundary 
flip-flops and the CCD scope is very limited. To specify the ports to exclude, set the 
ccd_ignore_ports_for_boundary_identification  application variable; If you specify 
ccd_ignore_scan_reset_for_boundary_identification  application variable, all of the 
scan/reset ports will not to be considered.
• The tool does not adjust the latencies of the boundary flip-flops
Note that setting the ccd_optimize_boundary_timing  application variables to false 
prevents CCD from optimizing most of the clock tree.

Description
This application variable is used to exclude the sink pins with attribute 
cts_fixed_balance_pin  during CCD optimization and the tool will not adjust the latencies of 
these pins.
The valid values are
• false  CCD in compile is free to adjust the latencies of the sink pins and does not honor 
the cts_fixed_balance_pin attribute on a pin
• true  CCD in compile will not adjust the latencies of the sink pins with attribute 
cts_fixed_balance_pin. But the latencies to the sink pins with attribute 
cts_fixed_balance_pin can still change because the clock cells in the clock path to 
these sink pins can still be optimized by CCD when skewing other sink pins
Examples
The following examples control CCD engine to avoid to adjust latency for 
 sinks pins with attribute cts_fixed_balance_pin:
prompt> set ccd_respect_cts_fixed_balance_pins true

ccd_write_script_sdc_add_offset_to_latency

Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
The ccd_write_script_sdc_add_offset_to_latency  application variable specifies how to 
write out the clock latency offset constraints that are generated during concurrent clock 
and data optimization (CCD) in Design Compiler NXT in topographical mode. However, 
latency offset is not a SDC standard. Therefore, the write_sdc  command ignores the 
latency offset constraints by default and the write_script  command writes the latency offset 
constraints separately.
When you set the ccd_write_script_sdc_add_offset_to_latency  variable to true,
1. The write_sdc  and write_script  commands add the latency offset value to latency value. 
This latency value is calculated from the user-defined latency constraints specified with 
the set_clock_latency  command without -offset  option.
2. The total latency value may be written out as latency value by set_clock_latency 
command without -offset  option. It may overwrites the existing user-defined clock 
latency constraints.

NET1 and the second element NET2, change_names  changes NET1 to A[0] and NET2 to 
A[1]. When this variable is set to true, change_names  does not change the names of bus 
members, so that NET1 and NET2 remain unchanged.
This variable also applies to -special  rules, but has no effect if the name is changed by

Description
The compile_auto_ungroup_area_num_cells  variable defines the minimum number of 
child cells a design hierarchy must have so that the compile -auto_ungroup area  command 
does not ungroup the hierarchy. The default value for this variable is 30. By default, the 
threshold check is done only on the child cells of its immediate hierarchy. You can enable 
the threshold check to include all of the leaf cells of this design hierarchy (for example, 
both the child cells of its immediate hierarchy and all of its subdesigns) by setting the 
compile_auto_ungroup_count_leaf_cells  variable to true.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
compile_auto_ungroup_area_num_cells  command. For a list of all compile variables and

Variable is not supported in DC Explorer
Description
The compile_auto_ungroup_count_leaf_cells  variable determines the way the tool counts 
the number of child cells of a design hierarchy. When this variable is set to false, the 
default value, only child cells in the immediate hierarchy are counted; the number of child 
cells in its subdesigns is considered.
When this variable is set to true, the leaf cells of a design hierarchy (for example, 
both the child cells of its immediate hierarchy and all its subdesigns) are considered. 
The number of child cells of a design hierarchy is compared against the value of 
compile_auto_ungroup_area_num_cells  in area-based auto-ungrouping to determine if a 
design hierarchy can be considered as a candidate for ungrouping.
Because of this, for the same design hierarchy and same variable 
settings for auto-ungroup, a certain design hierarchy may be ungrouped if 
compile_auto_ungroup_count_leaf_cells  is set to false, but may not be ungrouped 
if it is set to true. For example, assume design hierarchy A has 20 immediate child 
cells and a subdesign B, and subdesign B has another 40 immediate child cells 
with no more subdesigns. In a compile flow where compile -auto_ungroup area 
is used and the compile_auto_ungroup_area_num_cells  variable is set to 30, if 
compile_auto_ungroup_count_leaf_cells  is set to false, design hierarchy A will be 
considered as a candidate for auto-ungrouping because it has 20 < 40 child cells in its 
immediate hierarchy. However, if compile_auto_ungroup_count_leaf_cells  is set to true, 
since design A has 20+40 = 60 > 40 leaf cells, it will be not be considered as a candidate 
for auto-ungrouping.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
compile_auto_ungroup_count_leaf_cells  command. For a list of all compile variables and 
their current values, use the print_variable_group compile  command.

Description
This variable specifies whether the compiler considers a cell instance for automatic 
ungrouping, if the cell's wire load model is different from the wire load model of its parent 
cell. The default value is false, which means that the cell instance is not considered for 
automatic ungrouping should its wire load model differ from that of its parent.
If you set the value of this variable as true, the ungrouped child cells of the named cell 
instance inherit the wire load model of its parent. A result of setting this variable to true 
is that the tool might use more pessimistic wire load models for the child cells of this cell 
instance. This in turn might offset the delay improvement from the compile -auto_ungroup 
area  or -compile -auto_ungroup delay  command and lead to seemingly worse timing 
behavior for the design.

Description
During Post placement delay optimization, Design Compiler  can clump/over-
lap critical cells in the design while improving WNS, TNS. This could impact 
the correlation to post legalization result in IC Compiler II. When you set the 
compile_cell_density_aware_optimization  variable to true, Design Compiler identifies and 
reduces cell density violations, while performing Delay Optimizations. This lessens the

density violations when this variable is enabled, but not always a zero violation. This is not 
a placement feature and none of the placer density variables will affect it.

multiplexers in the fanin cone of asynchronous register pins. More specifically, if 
multiplexing logic (any MUX_OP or 2-input SELECT_OP) is found that is in the fanin of 
only asynchronous register pins (clock, and asynchronous set and reset), then this logic is 
mapped to a multiplexer, and a size-only attribute is set on the multiplexer. If the MUX_OP 
or SELECT_OP cell is specified as dont_touch, Design Compiler does not map the cell to 
a multiplexer. The purpose of this is to reduce the occurrence of glitches on asynchronous 
register pins. The default value of this variable is true.

Description
This variable controls NXT total power optimization feature which includes both sizing 
and placement related total power optimizations. For the DCNXT total power optimization 
feature to work in MCMM designs, atleast one scenario must set -setup true  and 
-dynamic_power true.
This variable is supported only in DCNXT shell topographical mode for -spg flow.
Allowed values are false  and true.
When set to false, DCNXT optimizes only for leakage power.
When set to true, DCNXT optimizes for both leakage and dynamic power. Enabling 
DCNXT total power optimization features can lead to different QoR tradeoff behaviors than 
the ones seen with the default compile flow and hence, it can affect WNS and/or TNS and/
or leakage power.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
compile_enable_total_power_optimization  command.

Description
When you set the compile_enhanced_tns_optimization  variable to true, the compile_ultra 
command while running in dcnxt_shell  runs a strategy intended to improve the TNS of the 
design, possibly at the cost of additional runtime, area, and worst negative slack (WNS).
Use the compile_ultra  command without the variable as the default strategy, and enable 
the compile_enhanced_tns_optimization  variable to fine-tune the flow as needed on 
designs that require further TNS optimization. This strategy performs a different method of 
selecting optimization candidates to achieve better TNS optimization.
To enable enhanced TNS optimization with the compile_ultra  and compile_ultra 
-incremental  commands, use the set_app_var compile_enhanced_tns_optimization true 
variable.
From R2020.09-SP1 compile_enhanced_tns_optimization_in_incremental  is on by default 
when compile_timing_high_effort_tns  is enabled and the user is running compile_ultra

To enable enhanced TNS optimization only with the compile_ultra  command and not with 
the compile_ultra -incremental  command, set the variables as follows:

prompt> set_app_var  compile_enhanced_tns_optimization_in_incremental

default in Design Compiler NXT non-topographical mode and Design Compiler NXT 
topographical mode
Description
With this variable set to default, the delay optimization engines strictly observe the value 
defined by the compile_enhanced_tns_optimization  variable. The default setting also 
allows backward compatibility, if needed.
From R2020.09-SP1 compile_enhanced_tns_optimization_in_incremental  is on by default 
when compile_timing_high_effort_tns  is enabled and the user is running compile_ultra 
-incremental.
However, setting the compile_enhanced_tns_optimization_in_incremental  variable to true 
or false  allows more explicit control over enhanced TNS optimization in the compile_ultra 
-incremental  flow step.
It is generally recommended
• To use the compile_ultra -incremental  command without enhanced TNS optimization as 
the default strategy
and
• To enable enhanced TNS optimization in the compile_ultra -incremental  step to fine-
tune the flow as needed on designs that require further TNS optimization
Depending on scripting and debugging requirements, enhanced TNS optimization can 
be enabled during the compile_ultra -incremental  step (if required) in one of the following 
ways:
• Set the compile_enhanced_tns_optimization  variable to true  only before the 
compile_ultra -incremental  step
or
• Set the compile_enhanced_tns_optimization_in_incremental  variable to true  at any 
point in the flow either before the compile_ultra  or compile_ultra -incremental  step
Setting of the variables is not order dependent, as the tool uses the 
compile_enhanced_tns_optimization  value for both compile and incremental compile, 
unless the compile_enhanced_tns_optimization_in_incremental  variable is set to true  or 
false.

compile_identify_synchronous_shift_register_effort
Controls the complexity and the number of synchronous shift registers identified by DC.

Description
The variable compile_identify_synchronous_shift_register_effort  has effect only if the 
synchronous shift registers identification Is enabled. When the value of this variable is 
set to none, synchronous shift registers (SSR) will be identified during compile_ultra 
command. However, optimization engines can modify the synchronous logic between the 
identified synchronous shift registers. Therefore, synchronous shift registers need to be 
re-identified again in insert_dft. The shift registers identified before insert_dft are not all 
preserved.
With this effort variable set to low, medium  or high, synchronous shift registers 
identification will happen in insert_dft when most of the optimizations are done. This helps 
preserving synchronous shift registers during insert_dft.
By setting the variable to low , Design Compiler will identify simplest synchronous shift 
registers. This effort usually provides better area improvements and minimizes the impact 
on timing. By setting the variable to medium, Design Compiler will identify even more 
synchronous shift registers. This of course produces better sequential area improvement, 
but timing may be impacted. By setting the variable to high , Design Compiler will identify 
all possible synchronous shift registers. The sequential area is further improved but the 
impact on timing can be high and overall area might increase.

By default, the columns in Table 1 are nine characters wide except for the ENDPOINT
column, which is 25 characters. The default precision for the floating-point data types
AREA, TOTAL NET SLACK, and DESIGN RULE COST is 1 digit to the right of the decimal
point; for WORST NEG SLACK, 2 digits.
There are 13 possible columns that can be displayed; only 6 are displayed in the default
format. You can create a customized output format by specifying any number of the
available columns, with their keywords and defaults. For example, specifying "%mem"
displays the MBYTES column with a width of 6 characters and a precision of 1 digit to
the right of the decimal point. When you specify "%mem", the following information is
displayed horizontally under these column names: COLUMN HEADER, DATA TYPE,
KEYWORD, WIDTH, PRECISION, and FORMAT.

Changing Default Column Parameters
You can change the default column parameters using the optional expression (w.pf,split),
as follows:
set_app_var compile_log_format = " %elap_time %area %wns %tns %drc
%endpoint".
where each column entry can be configured as follows:
"%keyword (w.pf, split)"
The quantities W, p, f, and split are defined as follows:
W
Specifies the column width. Specifying a width less than 6 defaults the width to
6. For string data types, specifying a width greater than 99 defaults the width to
99. For decimal or floating-point data types, specifying a width greater than 25
defaults to 25.
p
For floating-point numbers only. Specifies the precision in number of digits. See
also the definition of f.

f
For floating-point numbers only. Specifies the precision format; values are f or g. 
The value of f specifies that the precision is expressed as the number of digits 
to the right of the decimal point. The value of g specifies that the precision is 
expressed as the total number of significant digits. For example, expressing 
the floating-point number 13.533 with a precision of 3 in the f format reports the 
number as 13.533 while in the g format the number is reported as 13.5.
split
By default, if the information in a given field exceeds the column width, it pushes 
out the next field and the next field is not printed on a new line. Specifying split 
overrides the default and causes the next field to begin on a new line, starting in 
the correct column.

compile_no_new_cells_at_top_level
Controls whether the compile  command adds new cells to the top-level design.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
When this variable is set to true, no new cells are added to the top-level design of the 
hierarchy during compile. New cells are added only to lower levels.
This variable is used when the original design has no top-level cells, to prevent the 
addition of new cells when adding buffers for timing optimization and design rule fixes.
If the design has leaf cells at the top level, the cells are optimized as normal, so this 
variable should be set to false  (the default). Setting this variable to true  means that 
compile  will not add any cells during buffering and design rule fixing, even if the design is 
flat.
Note that if set_isolate_ports  requires insertion of new cells at the top level, then these 
cells will be added even if compile_no_new_cells_at_top_level  is set to true. This is 
because port isolation takes precedence.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar

compile_optimize_unloaded_seq_logic_with_no_bound_opt
Controls whether unused sequential logic is optimized away when boundary optimization

Boolean
Default false
Description
When this variable is set to true, the tool optimizes away unused sequential logic even 
when boundary optimization is disabled by setting the boundary_optimization  attribute to 
false  or using the -no_boundary_optimization  option with the compile_ultra  command.
In an attempt to remove sequential logic, the tool removes unloaded combinational logic 
and unloaded nets as well.
If unloaded hierarchical pins are used as connection points for post-compile steps, e.g. 
clock-gating, dft insertion, etc. then the logic and nets fanning into these pins will need to 
be protected by a dont_touch  in order to preserve them.
When the variable is set to false  (the default), the tool does not optimize unused 
sequential logic.

Data Types
Boolean
Default Variable is not supported in Design Compiler non-topographical mode and 
Design Compiler NXT non-topographical mode
false in Design Compiler topographical mode, DC Explorer, and Design Compiler NXT 
topographical mode
Description
When you set the compile_prefer_mux  variable to true, the compile_ultra  command runs 
a strategy intended to improve the congestion of designs that contain multiplexing logic, 
possibly at the cost of additional runtime and some area. The default flow typically maps 
most multiplexers to and-or-invert (AOI) logic in order to minimize area, but in some cases 
this can result in congestion hotspots. With compile_prefer_mux  enabled, multiplexing 
logic that is likely to cause congestion is converted to MUX trees where possible.
The compile_prefer_mux  variable is supported only in the initial compile step, not in 
incremental compile.
You can use the variable as an alternative to the map_to_mux  attribute, which requires 
you to manually investigate where the attribute needs to be applied.
Examples
The following example shows how to enable and disable congestion-driven MUX 
optimization for a design. Enable the compile_prefer_mux  variable by setting it to true 
before running the initial compile.

compile_preserve_pin_names_with_sizing
Controls sizing operations to only cells that are pin-name compatible.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
This option controls how the set of cells that can be used during sizing optimization is 
determined. It takes effect only on size_only cells. Possible values are true  and false. The 
default is set to false.
For example, assume that there are two buffer cells in the library. One buffer (buffA) has 
pins "A" and "O" and the other (buffX) has pins "X" and "Z".
When compile_preserve_pin_names_with_sizing  variable is set to false, buffA can 
be replaced with buffX (and vice versa) during sizing optimization. However, when 
compile_preserve_pin_names_with_sizing  is set to true, then buffA and buffX are not 
interchangeable anymore.
This variable can also cause QoR degradation as the valid set of cells available for sizing 
will be limited.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the get_app_var

Feedback
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
When this variable is set to true, it disables customization of logic external to a subdesign 
during compile, and preserves the subdesign interface. When set to false  (the default), 
compile  customizes the logic external to a subdesign based on the subdesign's internal 
logic.
compile_ultra -no_boundary_optimization  command sets this variable to true.
Optimization across hierarchies can take place in 2 different ways:
(1) Optimizing the logic external to a subdesign, based on that specific subdesign
In this type of optimization, the external logic is customized based on the contents of 
the subdesign. For example, if one of the output ports of the subdesign is internally 
grounded, then that constant can be pushed out to the higher level of the design and 
used at that level to further optimize the design. With this optimization, top-level ("pins-
out") functionality of all blocks is preserved. However, if the specification of the lower-level 
subdesign is then changed; for example, so that the output port is instead tied to a logic 
1, the higher level of the design cannot be updated accordingly. The logic propagation 
already occurred based on the original implementation of the subdesign.
By default, compile  performs this type of optimization. Setting 
compile_preserve_subdesign_interfaces  to true  disables the optimization.
(2) Optimizing the logic internal to a subdesign, based on its specific instantiation
In Design Compiler, hierarchical optimization of a subdesign's internal logic is referred to 
as boundary optimization. By default, compile  does not perform boundary optimization. 
You can enable boundary optimization for a particular module or for the entire 
design by running the compile -boundary_optimization  command or by setting the 
boundary_optimization  attribute on the desired object using the set_boundary_optimization 
command.
As a result of boundary optimization, the subdesign is customized for its specific 
environment. Boundary optimization results in an improved overall cost, but the subdesign 
is no longer functionally equivalent to its original specification. Therefore, the subdesign 
cannot be reused in an environment that does not match the environment for which it was 
optimized. For example, if one of the subdesign's input pins is tied externally to a logic 0, 
boundary optimization can push that logic constant into the subdesign and further optimize 
the logic in the subdesign. However, if this subdesign is then used in any environment 
where the input is no longer tied to a logic 0, the resulting design can be logically incorrect.

The compile_preserve_subdesign_interfaces  variable has no effect on objects that are 
enabled for boundary optimization.
By default, compile performs (1) described above, but not (2). When boundary 
optimization is enabled, both types of hierarchical optimization are performed.
Set the compile_preserve_subdesign_interfaces  variable to true  whenever the internal 
functionality of a subdesign might change in the future. In this case, compile  should be 
disabled from customizing the external logic based on the internal logic of the block. When 
the internal logic of all blocks has stabilized, you can set this variable to false  to allow 
further optimization of external logic based on the internal logic of the submodules.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
compile_preserve_subdesign_interfaces  command. For a list of compile variables and

This variable controls how the compile  command behaves when the optimize_registers 
or balance_registers  attribute is set on a design or parts of a design and the required 
licenses (BOA-BRT or DC-Expert) are not immediately available.
Allowed values are wait  (the default), stop, and next.
• If wait  is selected, compile  waits and checks every 5 minutes until the license becomes 
available. Once the license is available compile  resumes running.
• If stop  is selected, compile  is aborted immediately when the required license is not 
available.
• If next  is selected, retiming is executed with the a license allowing less capabilities. 
If the optimize_registers  attribute is set and the BOA-BRT license is not available, 
retiming will be run with the DC-Expert license. QoR will likely be worse. For the 
balance_registers  attribute, there is no lower-level capability, so next  has the same 
effect as stop  for balance_registers.
To avoid any waiting or aborting of the compile  command because of retiming licensing, 
obtain the required license in dc_shell before the start of compile. Use get_license BOA-
BRT  or get_license DC-Expert  repeatedly until the command is successful.

to use a library cell with the other type of asynchronous input and to invert the output of 
that cell.

inversion for compile_ultra, use the -no_seq_output_inversion  option to compile_ultra. Use

Description
When the value is true, flip-flops with synchronous reset or preset pins are mapped 
in one of the following ways: If your library has registers with synchronous reset (or 
preset) pins, the reset (or preset) net is connected to the reset (or preset) pin of a register 
with a dedicated reset (or preset) pin. If your library does not have any registers with 
synchronous reset (or preset) pins, the tool adds extra logic to the data input to generate 
the reset (or preset) condition on a register without a reset (or preset) pin. In these cases, 
Design Compiler attempts to map the logic as close as possible to the data pin to minimize 
X-propagation problems that lead to synthesis/simulation mismatches. It is still important 
to use the sync_set_reset  directive in your RTL so that Design Compiler can distinguish 
the reset (or preset) signals from other data signals and connect the reset signal as close 
to the register as possible.

Boolean
Default true
Description
When the value of this variable is set to the default value of true, Design Compiler Ultra 
automatically identifies shift registers in the design during test-ready compile.
When all of the shift registers are identified, only the first register is mapped to a scan cell, 
while the remaining registers are mapped to non-scan cells. This can save a significant 
amount of area for designs containing many identified shift registers.
Once these shift registers are identified by Design Compiler Ultra, DFT Compiler will also 
recognize the identified shift registers as shift-register scan segments. But DFT Compiler 
will break these scan segments, if necessary, to respect test setup requirements such as 
maximum chain length.

Shift registers that contain synchronous logic between the registers can also be identified 
if the synchronous logic can be controlled such that the data can be shifted from the 
output of the first register to the input of the next register. This synchronous logic can 
either be internal to the register (for example, synchronous reset and enable) or it can be 
external synchronous logic (for example, multiplexor logic between the registers). For shift 
registers identified with synchronous logic between the registers, DFT Compiler will add 
additional logic to the scan-enable signal during scan insertion in order to allow the data 
to be shifted between the registers when in scan mode. This capability is controlled by the 
compile_seqmap_identify_shift_registers_with_synchronous_logic  variable, and is enabled 
by default. See the compile_seqmap_identify_shift_registers_with_synchronous_logic 
variable man page for details.
Shift-register identification is only supported in test-ready compile with Design Compiler 
Ultra with a multiplexed scan-style.
Set the compile_seqmap_identify_shift_registers  variable to false  if you do not want 
compile_ultra -scan  to identify shift registers, or if you want to rescan the shift registers 
already identified in the design back to scan cells.

can either be internal to the register (for example, synchronous reset and enable), or it can 
be external synchronous logic (for example, multiplexer logic between the registers).
For shift registers that have been identified, only the first register is mapped to a scan cell 
while the remaining registers are mapped to nonscan cells. This can save a significant 
amount of area for designs containing many identified shift registers. This capability is only 
available with test-ready compilation when using a multiplexed scan style.
After the shift registers are identified by DC Ultra, DFT Compiler also recognizes the 
identified shift registers as shift-register scan segments. DFT Compiler breaks these scan 
segments, if necessary, to respect test setup requirements such as maximum chain length. 
For shift registers identified with synchronous logic between the registers, DFT Compiler 
adds additional logic to the scan-enable signal during scan insertion to allow the data to be 
shifted between the registers. This extra logic results in shared paths between the scan-
enable signal and the functional logic, so it is important not to set a dont_touch_network 
attribute on the scan-enable ports or signals. A dont_touch_network  attribute on the scan-
enable signal would propagate into functional logic paths, preventing the optimization of 
those paths and possibly leading to QoR degradation.
To disable timing optimization, use the set_case_analysis  command on scan-enable 
ports. To disable DRC fixing, use the set_ideal_network  command on the scan-enable 
ports. If the dont_touch_network  attribute must be used, use the set_dont_touch_network 
-no_propagate  command instead to avoid propagation of dont_touch into functional logic.
Set this variable to false  if you do not want DC Ultra to identify shift registers containing 
synchronous logic between the registers or if your design flow does not permit the 
insertion of additional logic on the scan-enable signal.
If you are using an ASCII flow before running DFT Compiler and shift registers with 
synchronous logic between the registers have been identified in the design, you must set 
the compile_seqmap_identify_shift_registers_with_synchronous_logic_ascii  variable to 
true  and use the set_scan_state test_ready  command to infer the shift registers again after 
reading in the ASCII netlist.

c_ascii
Controls the identification of synchronous-logic shift registers by the set_scan_state 
test_ready  command in an ASCII netlist flow.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
When this variable is set to true, the set_scan_state test_ready  command supports re-
identification of synchronous-logic shift registers for ASCII netlists. This flow requires a 
DC-Ultra license and a DFT-Compiler license. In addition, the following related variables 
must also be set:
set_app_var compile_seqmap_identify_shift_registers true
set_app_var 
 compile_seqmap_identify_shift_registers_with_synchronous_logic true
In a binary (regular) flow, shift register identification is performed by the compile_ultra 
-scan  command. The identified shift registers are annotated with attributes that are used 
by the DFT architect for reporting and scan stitching.
In an ASCII flow, these shift register attributes are not available in the test-ready netlist. As 
a result, the set_scan_state test_ready  command will re-identify shift registers when shift 
register identification is enabled.
When synchronous-logic shift register re-identification is enabled by this variable, the 
set_scan_state test_ready  command calls the DC Ultra shift register identification code 
(which identifies both simple and synchronous-logic shift registers). If this code identifies 
shift registers differently than the original test-ready synthesis run, the tool restructures the 
registers, scanning or unscanning registers as needed:
prompt> set_scan_state test_ready
Information: Performing full identification of complex shift registers. 
 (TEST-1190)
This restructuring can improve the quality of results, especially when importing netlists 
from flows without shift register identification. Although restructuring occurs only when 
this variable is set, the re-identification processes both simple and synchronous-logic shift 
registers.
Once the design is in a test_ready  state, running the set_scan_state test_ready  command 
again does not have any effect.

constant if it is forced into a state (0 or 1) from which it can never escape. A register is also 
constant if it cannot escape its reset state. The latter behavior is further controlled by the

The reset state of a register is determined by the presence of set and/or reset inputs on

This variable, when set to false, turns off the automatic ungrouping of small user design 
hierarchies at the beginning of the compile_ultra  flow.
Alternatively, you can achieve the same results by running the compile_ultra  command 
with the -no_autoungroup  option.

compile_update_annotated_delays_during_inplace_opt
Controls whether compile -in_place  can update annotated delay values in the 
neighborhood of swapped cells. It has no effect for reoptimize_design  and physopt, which 
always update annotated delay values.
Data Types
Boolean
Default true in Design Compiler non-topographical mode and Design Compiler NXT 
non-topographical mode
Variable is not supported in Design Compiler topographical mode, DC Explorer, and 
Design Compiler NXT topographical mode
Description
When true (the default value), compile -in_place  is allowed to modify the values of 
annotated delays on nets connected to the swapped cells and to remove annotated delays 
on cells connected to the swapped cells.
When false, compile -in_place  disallows annotated delays to be modified.
This variable is used to run compile -in_place  with annotated cell and net delays and 
allows the optimization to update the annotated delays to reflect the timing changes due to 
swapping cells.
For example, when a cell is swapped for a cell whose input pins have higher pin 
capacitances, the transition delay on the cells in the fanin increases and invalidates the 
delays annotated on these cells. In the same manner, swapping a cell will modify the slope 
component of the delay of cells in the fanout of the swapped cell, thus invalidating the 
delay annotated on these cells.

With this variable set to true, the annotated delays on cells in the fanin and fanout of the 
swapped cells are removed so that new cell delays will be calculated. It is important to 
back-annotate net resistances and especially net capacitances to get accurate cell delays.
With this variable set to true, the annotated delays on nets connected to the swapped 
cells are incrementally modified to take into account the change in load due to the new pin 
capacitance of the new cells.
Set this variable to false to disallow modification of annotated net delays and removal of 
annotated cell delays.

Description
By default, the extract_rc  command skips unrouted or partially routed nets and extracts 
only completely routed nets. To estimate partially routed or unrouted nets, you must use 
the extract_rc  command with the -estimate  option. Consequently, you must run both 
extract_rc  and extract_rc -estimate  to completely extract a partially routed design.

Mixed-mode extraction simplifies this process by enabling simultaneous handling of routed

• The extract_rc  command performs detailed extraction first, followed by estimation for 
broken or unrouted nets.
• When you run the write_parasitics  command after doing mixed-mode extraction, it 
writes out mixed-mode parasitics.
To disable the mixed-mode extraction capability, set the value of this variable to false.

cts_clock_source_is_exclude_pin
This variable controls the cascaded create-clock behavior. If this variable is set to 
true, clock tree synthesis (CTS) marks the clock source of a downstream create_clock 
command as an implicit exclude pin.
Data Types
Boolean
Default true
Description
This variable controls the cascaded create-clock behavior. When set to true, it enables 
CTS to mark the sources of cascaded create_clocks downstream as implicit exclude pins 
for the purpose of upstream clocks. This behavior is consistent with the timer behavior for 
cascaded clocks. For example, the following command:
prompt> create_clock CLK1
has a create_clock CLK2  defined in its fanouts at pin PIN2. CTS marks PIN2 as an implicit 
exclude pin for CLK1. PIN2 is still a valid driver for CLK2. This de-couples the two clocks 
and prevents quality of results (QoR) degradation resulting from the synthesis order of 
CLK1 and CLK2. If CLK1 is synthesized first, PIN2 still has a huge design rule checking 
(DRC) violation because CLK2 has not yet been touched by CTS. This affects the results 
for CLK1 when CTS tries to balance an unsythesized tree with other synthesized trees.

dc_allow_rtl_pg
Allows Design Compiler to read RTL containing a limited set of PG (power/ground) nets 
and pin connections.
Data Types
Boolean
Description
When true, RTL read into Design Compiler can contain some PG nets and PG pin 
connections. These can represent wiring of macros and other special cells but cannot 
entail a full power netlist.
PG nets must be declared in the RTL as ordinary wires and/or ports. They must not be 
driven by constants or declared as supply0/supply1.
The RTL PG nets can be connected to leaf cell pins as long as these pins are declared 
as PG pins in the technology library. This is how a net is inferred as a PG net. In addition, 
such nets can also be connected to signal pins of leaf cells.
PG connections can only be made to macros, pad cells, and power management cells, 
such as power switches, level shifters, and isolation cells. Connections can also be made 
to hierarchical cells; the associated pins and ports are inferred as PG pins and ports. 
Design Compiler does not permit PG net connections to standard cells.
If RTL containing PG nets has been read, these nets and pin connections, and associated 
ports, are removed from the logic netlist. They can optionally be included in Verilog output 
by using the write_file -format verilog -pg  command. If the -pg  option is not used, the PG 
nets and ports will not appear.
In the UPF flow, execution of the UPF commands 'create_supply_port supply_port' and 
'create_supply_net supply_net' will result in the logical port/net being removed from the 
logical netlist. Also, execution of these commands will not throw up any error messages 
related to name space conflicts.

dcnxt_adaptive_disable_for_sched_affinity
Disables the use of adaptive multithreading features when manual management of core 
assignments is detected.
Data Types
Boolean
Default Variable is not supported in Design Compiler non-topographical mode, Design 
Compiler topographical mode, and DC Explorer
false in Design Compiler NXT non-topographical mode and Design Compiler NXT

Description
When execution on more than one core is requested using set_host_options 
-max_cores, by default DCNXT optimizes multithreading performance by dynamically 
adapting its workload to the available CPU resources. See the manpage for 
dcnxt_adaptive_multithreading  for details.
The variable dcnxt_adaptive_disable_for_sched_affinity  controls how DC-NXT behaves 
when it detects that scheduling affinity settings are in use for the current process. Such 
manual management of core assignments cause the machine performance metrics used 
by DC-NXT to guide multithreading use, to not accurately reflect the actual availability 
of core resources. Hence, DC-NXT may not be able to correctly adjust its multithreading 
behavior in that environment.
By default, dcnxt_adaptive_disable_for_sched_affinity  is set to true. Under that setting, 
DC-NXT disables the adaptive multithreading feature when manual core management is 
detected.
To continue to use adaptive multithreading when scheduling affinity constraints exist, set 
the dcnxt_adaptive_multithreading  variable to false.
The default for the dcnxt_adaptive_disable_for_sched_affinity  variable is true.

Description
When execution on more than one core is requested using set_host_options -max_cores, 
DCNXT optimizes multithreading performance by dynamically adapting its workload to the

Description
This variable determines whether the report_timing  command and other commands 
will use automatic time borrowing. When the value is false  (the default), automatic time 
borrowing occurs. Automatic time borrowing balances the slack along back-to-back latch 
paths, to reduce the overall delay cost. Allocating slack throughout the latch stages can 
improve optimization results.
When set to true, no slack balancing occurs during time borrowing. This means the first 
paths borrow enough time to meet the constraint until the max_time_borrow  is reached. 
Setting the variable to true  produces time-borrow results consistent with PrimeTime.

Default false
Description
This feature is superseded by dcnxt_adaptive_multithreading. When that variable is true, 
the checks described here are not performed.
When dcnxt_adaptive_multithreading  is false, the tool checks resource requirements in 
the multicore flow, such as the number of cores available and the load average on the 
host machine. If the host machine does not meet the resources that you specified with the 
set_host_options  command, the tool overrides your set_host_options  settings and uses 
the optimal resources available on the host machine.
You can override this behavior by setting the disable_multicore_resource_checks  variable 
to true. In this case, the tool disables the resource checking on the host machine and uses 
your set_host_options  settings. However, this can slow down the tool if the host does not 
have the necessary cores or is heavily loaded.
The default for the disable_multicore_resource_checks  variable is false.

This variable controls how the timing engine (i.e., the update_timing  command) handles 
undriven leaf and hierarchical input pins.
When this variable is set to its default of false, the timing engine applies a case analysis 
value of 0 at undriven pins. This is consistent with how synthesis optimizes the logic.

dont_tie_unused_hierarchical_iopins_to_logic_constant
Specifies if unused hierarchical iopins (no driver and no load) should be connected to 
constant tie-off cells during loading of the design.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
This variable controls whether unused hierarchical iopins should connect to constant tie-off 
cells during loading of the design.
An unused hierarchical iopin is a pin of a hierarchical cell that has no drivers and no loads 
associated with it. This means that there are no leaf cells and no ports connected to the 
hierarchical pin. Nets and connections to other hierarchical iopins are not accounted.
When you set this variable to false (the default), the tool ties unused hierarchical iopins to 
logic 0 during loading of the design, as shown in the following diagram:
+----------------------------------+
  | TOP     +------------------+     |
  |         | BLK              |     |
  |      +--o               +--o     |

  |    1'b0 |             1'b0 |     |
  |         +------------------+     |
  +----------------------------------+
For unused input pins, the constant is driven in the parent hierarchy. For unused output 
pins, the constant is driven from inside the hierarchical block.
When you set this variable to true  before reading in the design, the tool leaves unused 
hierarchical iopins undriven, as shown in the following diagram:
+----------------------------------+
  | TOP     +------------------+     |
  |         | BLK              |     |

dont_touch_nets_with_size_only_cells
Specifies whether a net is marked as dont_touch when it connects at least one leaf-level 
size-only driver and at least one leaf-level size-only load.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
When set to true, this variable indicates whether nets with one of the following types of 
connections will have an implicit dont_touch attribute marking. These connections are 
considered transparently across design hierarchies.
• The net connects a leaf-level size-only driving cell and at least one leaf-level size-only 
load cell
• The net connects a top-level input port and a leaf-level size-only load cell
• The net connects a leaf-level size-only driving cell and a top-level output port
If a net is explicitly set as dont_touch false  by using the set_dont_touch  command, this 
dont_touch setting supersedes the dont_touch marking derived from the variable.
Cells can be marked as size-only by using the set_size_only  command.
Be cautious when setting this variable to true. If a net is marked as dont_touch, it 
cannot be changed by commands that optimize or manipulate the design. In particular, 
dont_touch feedthrough nets and the dont_touch nets connected to two output ports will 
not be fixed.
The default value of this variable is false.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
dont_touch_nets_with_size_only_cells  command. For a list of compile variables and their 
current values, use the print_variable_group compile  command.

enable_bit_blasted_bus_linking
Resolves the mismatches between bit-blasted bus bits and the buses during the link 
process.
Data Types
Boolean
Default true
Description
Setting this variable to true allows the linker to recognize bit-blasted buses by pin names 
during the link process. If the pin names follow a specific pattern, the tool infers a bus 
when encountering the individual bits.
Typically, the RTL pin names and the logic library pin names should match. Signals are 
defined the same way in both the RTL and the library. They are defined as buses or a 
bus is defined by its individual wires. Occasionally, mismatches occur during design 
development; for example, when you transfer the design from one technology to another. 
To fix the mismatches, you can set the enable_bit_blasted_bus_linking  variable to true 
before the design is read.
When you set the enable_bit_blasted_bus_linking  variable to true, the linker 
allows you to read your design even if pin name mismatches occur. By default, this 
variable is set to false, but the default for DC Explorer is true. Note that when this 
variable is set to true, the tool matches pin names according to the setting of the 
bit_blasted_bus_linking_naming_styles  variable.
You specify the pin name patterns by using the bit_blasted_bus_linking_naming_styles 
variable. For example:
prompt> set bit_blasted_bus_linking_naming_styles {%s[%d]}

Data Types

Default false
Description
This variable, when set to true, enables timing analysis of clock-to-data pins when the 
clock is ideal. The ideal clock latency is used as the data arrival time at the clock-to-data 
pin, and the ideal transition is used as data transition time at that pin. If more than one 
clock drives the data pin, the worst latency and transition values apply.
When the variable is set to false  (the default), the tool uses the actual propagated clock 
latency and transition time at the clock-to-data pin, if any, and ignores any ideal clock 
latency and transition time set for the clock.
A clock-to-data pin is a cell's data input pin in the fanout of a clock, such as the input of a 
clock divider circuit. A pin attribute called pin_is_clock_to_data is set to true for these pins.
You can set the ideal latency and ideal transition time of a clock by using the 
set_clock_latency  and set_clock_transition  commands.

Description
This variable, when set to true, enables the golden UPF mode. By default, the variable is

writes out a full set of UPF commands that reflect the changes made by the tool to the 
UPF power intent of the design, as well as the UPF commands run during the tool session.
In the golden UPF mode, the same original "golden" UPF script file is used throughout 
the synthesis, physical implementation, and verification flow. The save_upf  command 
writes out a supplemental UPF file that reflects only the changes made by the tool to 
the UPF power intent of the design. Downstream tools and verification tools use the 
golden and supplemental UPF files together to completely specify the power intent of the 
design. To use the golden UPF mode, set this variable to true before you execute any UPF 
commands. Once enabled, the golden UPF mode requires that you run UPF commands 
only by using the load_upf  command. You cannot execute individual UPF commands at 
the shell prompt, except for UPF query commands.
In the golden UPF mode, the save_upf  command writes out a supplemental UPF file, 
which contains only the UPF changes made by the tool during the session, such as tool-
derived power intent and addition of power management cells. You can choose to write out 
a concise or verbose supplemental UPF file. A verbose file contains connect_supply_net 
commands that connect supply nets to the power management cells; these commands are 
needed if the netlist written in the session does not include PG connections. If the netlist 
includes PG connections, you can write out a concise supplemental UPF file instead.

Description
When you set the enable_keep_signal  variable to true, the tool preserves marked nets 
throughout the compile process.
To mark a net to be preserved, the net should have the keep_signal_name label on it in 
the RTL source, and the hdlin_keep_signal_name  variable should be set to either user  or 
user_driving, depending on the nets to be preserved. See the hdlin_keep_signal_name 
variable man page for more information.
At the beginning of the compile process, the tool issues an OPT-154 message, 
indicating the presence of these marked nets. Note that preserving a net can cause QoR 
degradation.
Qor Impact:
• Logic connected to the preserved net is marked size_only.
• Automatic ungrouping of user hierarchies is disabled if the hierarchy has a preserved 
net connected to one of its ports.
• Constant propagation is disabled through preserved nets because the nets are marked 
dont_touch.
• Equal and opposite net optimization is disabled for preserved nets.
• The deletion of unused logic is disabled on the input cone of a preserved net.
Limitations:
• Ungrouping of synthetic cells during compile can cause the loss of a preserved net 
connected to its outputs (for example, two output nets of a synthetic cell that end up 
being driven by the same internal driver after ungrouping of the synthetic cell).
• Requests to preserve nets inside mapped synthetic cells post compile are ignored. Use 
a dont_touch explicitly on the synthetic cell hierarchy.
• Requests to preserve nets inside hierarchical clock-gating cells are ignored. Use a 
dont_touch explicitly on the clock-gating cell.

enable_keep_signal_dt_net
Determines whether the tool forces preservation of a signal throughout compilation.
Data Types
Boolean

Description
When you set the enable_keep_signal_dt_net  variable to true, the tool preserves marked 
nets during compilation.
Set the enable_keep_signal_dt_net  variable to true  before you use the set_dont_touch 
command on the net to mark it for preservation. Setting the dont_touch  attribute on a net 
sets an implicit size_only on logic connected to that net even if logic connected to it is 
unmapped and not combinational.
At the beginning of compilation, the tool issues an OPT-154 warning indicating the 
presence of nets mark for preservation throughout compile. Preserving specific nets 
throughout compilation can cause quality of results (QoR) degradation. If you preserve a 
net that is in the critical path, the QoR degradation can be severe. This net preservation 
functionality is intended to facilitate verification. It should not be used to achieve final QoR 
goals.
Qor Impact:
• Logic connected to the preserved net is marked size_only.
• Automatic ungrouping of user hierarchies is disabled if the hierarchy has a preserved 
net connected to one of its ports.
• Constant propagation is disabled through preserved nets because the nets are marked 
dont_touch.
• Equal and opposite net optimization is disabled for preserved nets.
• The deletion of unused logic is disabled on the input cone of a preserved net.

Limitations:
• Ungrouping of synthetic cells during compile can cause the loss of a preserved net 
connected to its outputs (for example, two output nets of a synthetic cell that end up 
being driven by the same internal driver after ungrouping of the synthetic cell).
• Requests to preserve nets inside mapped synthetic cells post compile are ignored. Use 
a dont_touch explicitly on the synthetic cell hierarchy.
• Requests to preserve nets inside hierarchical clock-gating cells are ignored. Use a

Description
This variable, when set to true, enables the acceptance of recovery and removal arcs 
specified in the technology library. Recovery or removal timing arcs impose constraints 
on asynchronous pins of sequential cells. Typically, recovery time specifies the time the 
inactive edge of the asynchronous signal has to arrive before the closing edge of the 
clock. Removal time specifies the length of time the active phase of the asynchronous 
signal must be held after the closing edge of clock.
To enable the compile, report_timing, and report_constraint  commands to accept recovery 
or removal arcs specified in the library, set enable_recovery_removal_arcs  to true.
Note that independent of the value of this variable, the write_timing  and 
report_delay_calculation  commands always accept and report recovery or removal timing 
information.
This variable is the logical opposite of the variable 
timing_disable_recovery_removal_checks. If you set either one of these variables to true, 
the tool automatically sets the other variable to false, and vice versa.

enable_slew_degradation
Determines whether the transition degradation is considered for nets with physical 
information.
Data Types
Boolean
Default true
Description
When this variable is set to true  (the default value), timing calculation takes into account 
transition degradation across a net. For a long net, this might mean that the transition 
at the net driver could be very different than the various load pins. Because all load pins 
on the same net might not have the same transition time, optimization with physical 
information fixes transitions on a per pin basis. This might lead to increased runtime for 
these commands.
Setting this variable to false  causes the timing calculation to not calculate transition 
degradation across a net. However, some libraries do have a transition degradation 
table that shows how to degrade the transition across a net. If slew degradation 
is not enabled, then the library transition degradation tables are used unless the 
disable_library_transition_degradation  variable is set to true.
If neither slew degradation nor library transition degradation is enabled, the transition at 
the net driver will be the same transition at the load pin. Because all load pins on the same 
net have the same transition time, optimization with physical information attempts to fix 
transitions on a per net basis.
Regardless of the setting of this variable, slew degradation does not occur for multidriven 
nets. For multidriven nets, there can be cases of too much pessimism.
Regardless of the setting of this variable, slew degradation can only occur if there is either 
delay back-annotation for the net or physical locations for the pins of the net. Otherwise, 
the transition time calculation at the driver pin is too inaccurate to be degraded.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar enable_slew_degradation 
command. For a list of all timing variables and their current values, use the 
print_variable_group timing  command.

For each input port the I/O latency for max case is defined as the minimum clock network 
latency for the clocks in the fanout set of the port. The I/O latency for min case is the 
maximum clock latency in the fanout set.
For each output port the I/O latency for max case is defined as the maximum clock 
network latency for the clocks in the fanin set of the port. The I/O latency for min case is 
the minimum clock latency in the fanin set.
The I/O latency is not added to external delay in timing calculations if the 
network_delay_included  switch is used. The ideal clocks are not used for I/O latency 
calculation.
This variable is best used after clock tree synthesis.

By default, the power critical range value is zero, and leakage-power recovery is 
performed only those cells with positive slack (cells on nonviolating paths).
When you set this variable to a positive number, the command preserves timing QoR with

negative number, the command performs more aggressive leakage-power recovery and 
allows timing degradation.
This variable applies only to the focal_opt -power  command. This variable applies to all

Description
This variable controls the maximum length of compound names of bus bundles for the 
create_schematic -sge  command. The default length is 256, which is the maximum length 
supported by SGE. Any buses with names longer than this variable are decomposed into 
their individual members in the schematic. If any such buses connect to cells referencing 
library symbols, those library symbols are ignored and new gen-created symbols are used. 
Any buses that these gen-created symbols have whose compound names exceed this 
length are blown up into their individual members.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
gen_max_compound_name_length  command. For a list of all schematic variables and 
their current values, use the print_variable_group schematic  command.

Description
This variable specifies the maximum allowed size of a symbol created by the 
create_schematic  command. For example, if this variable is set to 5, symbols with no more 
than 5 ports on any 1 side are created. If this variable is not set or is set to 0, all input ports 
are placed on the left side of the symbol and all inout and output ports are placed on the 
right side.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
gen_max_ports_on_symbol_side  command. For a list of all schematic  variables and their 
current values, use the print_variable_group schematic  command.

Description
Setting this variable to true enables reporting of all missing objects when you reapply the 
golden UPF file to the design with the load_upf  command.
In the golden UPF flow, the synthesis and physical implementation tools can change or 
remove objects in the design due to optimization, grouping, ungrouping, or expansion 
of wildcard names. Therefore, when you reapply the same golden UPF to the modified 
design, missing objects are expected as a normal part in the flow.
For this reason, by default, the tool does not report missing objects during reapplication 
of the golden UPF to the design, except for missing control signals identified by the 
set_isolation_control, set_retention_control  and create_power_switch  commands. 
These signals are not expected to be changed or removed by synthesis or physical 
implementation tools.
To enable reporting of all missing objects under these conditions, set the 
golden_upf_report_missing_objects  to true. In that case, during reapplication of the golden 
UPF with the load_upf  command, all missing objects are reported.
To determine the current value of this variable, use printvar 
golden_upf_report_missing_objects  command. For a list of all mv variables and their 
current values, use the print_variable_group mv  command.

Description
The gui_analyze_rtl_paths  variable specifies the minimum number of timing paths that the

Starting with the bin that contains the paths with the most logic levels, the tool evaluates 
the paths in each bin from right to left. If the number of logic levels on at least one path 
exceeds its threshold value, the bin is colored red. The tool continues to color the bins red 
until it reaches the gui_analyze_rtl_paths  number of paths. After reaching this value, the 
tool colors the bins white until it finds a bin in which none of the paths contain more logic 
levels than their threshold values. The rest of the bins are colored green.

Description
This variable allows you to be in debug mode to clean RTL with elaboration errors, link 
errors, and internal errors, similar to DC Explorer.
HDL Compiler elaborates a design in a top-down hierarchical order. By default, this 
variable is false  (unless using DC Explorer), so the elaboration failure of a certain module 
prohibits the elaboration of all child modules. This behavior is safe but less informative.
When this variable is set to true  (as in DC Explorer), HDL Compiler continues to elaborate 
its child modules even if a module's elaboration fails. In this way, HDL Compiler can 
elaborate as many modules as possible in a single elaboration run. Thus, more RTL code 
elaboration problems can be detected in a single run, which improves efficiency.
This variable works for both the elaborate  and read  command.
To benefit from this variable, the designs must be free from syntax errors during the 
analyze process.
In Design Compiler, in hdlin_elab_errors_deep  mode, no designs are created after 
elaboration. So commands such as current_design  or link  do not work in this debug mode.
In DC Explorer, even in hdlin_elab_errors_deep  mode (default), designs are created after 
elaboration. So commands such as current_design  or link  works in this debug mode.

Here top, mod1, mod2 are names of modules as coded in the RTL.
The warning message (ELAB-748) is generated during the elaborate  or read  command. 
An example of the message is shown below:
Warning:  ./test.sv:521: The body of module 'mod2' is being discarded, 
 because the module name is not in hdlin_elaborate_black_box_all_except.

The valid module names are those coded in the RTL and the design names, e.g. those 
reported by list_designs, giving priority to the design names.
If a modules RTL name meets hdlin_elaborate_black criteria and its design name meets 
hdlin_elaborate_black_box_all_except criteria, its body will not be ignored.
If a modules design name meets hdlin_elaborate_black_box criteria and its RTL name

hdlin_enable_assertions
Controls the tool's use of SystemVerilog Assertions.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Group
hdl_variables
Description
Setting hdlin_enable_assertions  to true  allows the elaborate  and read_sverilog  commands 
to process a synthesis-friendly subset of SystemVerilog RTL Assertions. Facts added via 
assertions can contribute to optimization by ruling out machine states that cannot arise 
during normal operation of the design. This switch controls actions taken only during the 
elaborate phase, including elaborations that occur during linkage or compilation.

To be activated, an assertion statement must belong to a narrow category of synthesizable 
deferred immediate assertions. It must have a dedicated statement label that gives 
it a unique, lexically scoped name. It also must be analyzed in sverilog  format (or by 
read_sverilog).
The asserted expression should compare only one variable or signal to a compile-time 
constant, or else it should make a $onehot or $onehot0 claim about a collection of signal 
wires.
Consult the HDL Compiler for SystemVerilog User Guide  for the exact definition of the 
subset currently supported by this release. All labeled assertions within this subset survive 
analysis,
To confirm that an assertion should be considered during optimization do the following:
• Set hdlin_enable_assertions true  when it is being elaborated.
• Set the lexically scoped name of its statement label as an element of the 
confirmed_SVA()  array variable in the tool environment in which the assertion is 
elaborated. Set it to the value of true.
When the above conditions are met, the labeled and confirmed assertions encoded in the 
intermediate (or template) design files can begin to influence logic minimization done by 
the tool.
Note that either linking or elaborating designs with unresolved template references can 
cause subdesign elaborations whose confirmed assertions may also be exploited by 
the tool's optimizations. The following is an example that confirms 3 assertions named 
assertion_label1, global_assertion1, and assumption_about_port:
analyze -f sverilog my_file.sv
# The following lines can be brought in via a source command
set confirmed_SVA(module1.scope1.assertion_label1) true
set confirmed_SVA(module1.global_assertion1) true
set confirmed_SVA(module2.generated_scope[0].assumption_about_port) true

hdlin_enable_configurations
Controls the configuration support by the tool.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Group
hdl_variables
Description
The hdlin_enable_configurations  variable enables configuration support by the tool when 
set to true. The default value is false.
To specify a configuration, use the analyze  command. To elaborate an entity with a 
specific configuration, use the elaborate  command with the configuration name as the 
design name. For example, if file.vhdl contains the configuration named my_configuration, 
read and elaborate the design as follows:
prompt> set hdlin_enable_configurations true
prompt> analyze -f vhdl file.vhdl
prompt> elaborate my_configuration
The read  command ignores configurations.
Setting this variable to true  entails more stringent link-time checks. If designs do not use 
configurations, it is advised not to turn on this switch.

Description
This flow is available for cases where differences in logical hierarchy inference between 
Design Compiler and Formality causes mis-application of SVF constraints leading to a 
failure in verification.
For these cases, Design Compiler can issue a different style of SVF guidance with 
respect to the design hierarchy than the usual flow. Design Compiler produces a set of 
guide_hier_map  guidances to capture a baseline for the logical hierarchy, before switching 
to the regular guide_instance_map  guidances for any further changes to the logical 
hierarchy.
This variable must be set to true  prior to any design read commands (analyze, elaborate, 
read_verilog, read_file, etc.) This variable setting will enable the set_verification_top 
command (see below for usage) and suppress guide_instance_map  guidances that are 
normally generated in (V)HDL Compiler.
This flow also requires that the set_verification_top  command be added to your design 
read flow. This command must be run after the final elaborate  command of your design 
read step, and prior to any further steps such as compile_ultra, grouping or ungrouping, 
etc.
This command generates the guide_hier_map  guidances as the first guidances in the 
SVF file. Then subsequent SVF guidances will be consistent with this logical hierarchy 
baseline.
If hdlin_enable_hier_map  is set to true  and no set_verification_top  command is issued 
before SVF generation is terminated, an error message is issued.
Examples
The following script shows the correct command ordering for this flow.
# Specify SVF output file
prompt> set_svf ./guidance/top.svf
 
# Enable GHM flow
prompt> set_app_var hdlin_enable_hier_map true
 
# Read design files
prompt> analyze -format sverilog {sub.sv top.sv}
prompt> elaborate top
prompt> current_design top
 
# Issue this command after reading last RTL file and before
# other commands that can modify netlist

last action it overwrites that file with the current macro definitions (or creates the file if it 
doesn't exist yet).
For example, if the analyze command encounters `undef directives or macro redefinitions, 
those changes will be reflected in the file at the end of the analyze command.
Like the intermediate files that are saved into libraries, the macro definitions file is 
protected with Synopsys encryption.
It is recommended to remove any macros definition file that might be left over from a

By default Presto HDL Compiler will not attempt to infer set/reset logic that it estimates to 
be 'complex', for example, driven by some other instance or with many gates between the 
input and the sequential cell. And the complex set/reset logic will stay on the data line of 
the sequential cell.
For quality of result it's usually desirable for the set/reset logic to be fast and simple, but 
when this is not so, setting the variable to true tells Presto HDL Compiler to consider some 
additional, more complex possibilities, although potentially at the cost of increased runtime 
and memory usage.

The hdlin_interface_port_ABI  variable is effective only when HDL Compiler (Presto) 
parses the source code of an interface  or module  declaration in SystemVerilog format (-f

to be used when interface instances or ports connect across a subdesign port. Because 
this setting is recorded when the interface is analyzed, its author can determine interface-
specific aspects the ABI conventions once for all users, independent of any other 
interfaces they might also use. Since the setting is also recorded by modules that form and 
pass along arrays of interface instances, it allows a module which creates arrays to specify 
the conventions for connecting them to its subdesigns.
The memory elements and signal wires synthesized specifically for each interface instance 
connect to physical input, output, or inout ports at every hierarchical boundary where that 
interface instance connects to other design elements through an interface port or modport. 
The "Application Binary Interface" (ABI) is a set of conventions for which connections to 
make, their positional order and port names, and how to treat the contents of arrayed 
interface ports. Both designs being connected must agree on the ABI of their actual and 
formal interface ports. This agreement occurs automatically when both interface clients

are elaborated using identical versions of the interface, analyzed with the same choice of 
ABI setting. Usually it suffices to analyze the interface once into a design library (such as 
"WORK") shared by all its clients as they are elaborated.
The integer value of hdlin_interface_port_ABI  encodes a bit vector with one bit position for 
each ABI feature. Its default value is 3'b010.
bit[0] Canonical Bounds (ABI 3'b??0 vs 3'b??1)
Bit 0 only affects arrayed ports (of subdesign reference cells) whose elements are 
instances (or modports) of some interface definition. The ABI bit[0] of the current module 
controls, not the ABI of the interface or the down design. The effect is noticeable only 
when the interface array actual port expression has bounds that differ from the canonical 
bounds for unpacked arrays (such as [n] or [0:n-1]) and the actual port is passed 
by .portname(...). In these cases, the array index values are explicit in the port names 
being matched by Design Compiler's linker.
• An interface array connected from a module whose ABI value is 0  in bit position 0 (this 
is the default) uses the actual array expression's bounds to invent port names of the 
reference cell. Note that different instantiations of the same down design might then 
require distinct formal port names, and these will be produced by multiple elaborations 
of the down design.
• An interface array connected from a module whose ABI value is 1  in bit position 0 uses 
canonical bounds to invent port names of the reference cell. Note that part-selects of 
unpacked arrays always produce canonical bounds, so this option avoids the primary 
source of multiple elaboration due to bounds-matching.
Note that with either setting, formal port names can differ from the internal net names 
to which they connect. In fully linked designs, this produces net names in the down 
design that are taken from their connectivity with the top design. The canonical setting 
exactly resembles the names produced during linkage for all other forms of bused ports
bit[1] Demoted Modports (ABI 3'b?0? vs 3'b?1?)
Bit 1 affects only those port connections where the formal interface port specifies a 
modport and the actual interface instance does not.
When the value in bit position 1 is 1  (the default), these connections are successfully 
linked per the IEEE-1800 standard definition. This is accomplished by adding dummy 
(unused) formal ports to a special elaboration of the design that correspond in name and 
position to all interface content that lies outside the given formal modport. This elaboration 
uses a different -param  string than that produced for a design reference with matching 
modport specifications for this interface.
When the value in bit position 1 is 0, no special elaboration is created to accommodate 
formal-only modport selection; no dummy formal ports are added. In general, this will

prevent linkage of an actual interface instance to a formal modport selected by the down 
design.
Note that the default (demote) setting allows interface modport connections to be made 
using .* and .portname forms as the actual port. The cost of this convenience is the 
introduction of unused design ports.
bit[2] API-style (ABI 2'b0?? vs 3'b1??)
Bit positions 2 and above are reserved for future extensions of the interface port ABI. 
Premature use of these settings is not supported.

hdlin_interface_port_downto

arrayed interface port declaration.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
Ths variable controls the HDLC canonicalization of GTECH ports inferred from a 
SystemVerilog RTL arrayed interface port declaration.
When the variable is set to false  (the default), the GTECH ports will be in a little-endian 
style with the leftmost ports indexed with 0. When the variable is set to true, the GTECH 
ports will instead be in big-endian style with the rightmost ports indexed with 0.
It is recommended that an entire SystemVerilog design either consistently declare all 
arrayed interface ports with the C-style [N] syntax (that means [0:N-1]) or consistently 
declare all of them as [N-1:0] but also enable this variable.

Description
This variable controls how the analyze  command stores the data from analyzed RTL files, 
which is subsequently used by the elaborate  command.
The hdlin_intermediate_file_method  variable can be set as follows:
• legacy  - The data is stored as multiple files (named after module, interfaces or 
packages names) in the directory defined by the define_design_lib  command.
• compact  - The data is stored in a single file (named "default.hdllib") in the directory 
defined by the define_design_lib  command.
• none  - The data is stored in memory instead of on disk.
For the values of legacy  and compact, the data remains persistent and available for use by 
elaboration in subsequent sessions.
For the value of none, all RTL analysis and elaboration must be performed in a single 
session. However, runtime can improve significantly (versus storing files on disk) if the 
filesystem performance is poor.
If the hdlin_auto_save_templates  application variable is set to true, then this variable also 
affects the read_verilog  and read_sverilog  commands.
This variable applies only to Verilog and SystemVerilog RTL analysis; it is not yet 
implemented for VHDL RTL analysis.

Default all_driving
Description
The hdlin_keep_signal_name  variable is available only in HDL Compiler (Presto Verilog) 
and HDL Compiler (Presto VHDL). For this discussion, these tools will be referred to as 
Presto. The original HDL and VHDL compilers do not support hdlin_keep_signal_name.
The value of hdlin_keep_signal_name  determines whether Presto attempts to keep a 
signal name. This includes preserving cells between the signal and the input or output 
port. The hdlin_keep_signal_name  variable provides Presto with guideline information 
for keeping a signal name, but it is not intended to be a 100% guarantee for keeping 
a signal. In some Presto optimizations, such as removing redundant code, the signal 
name may be optimized away, even if the signal is associated with the keep_signal_name 
attribute or directive. The allowed values are all, none, user, user_driving, and all_driving, 
as described below. The user  and user_driving  values require the keep_signal_name 
directive.
none
Presto does not attempt to keep any signals. This value overrides the 
keep_signal_name  directive.
all
Presto attempts to preserve a signal if the signal is not removed by 
optimizations. Dangling and driving nets are considered. This value does not 
guarantee that a signal is kept. The all  value generally preserves fewer signals 
than the user  value. For example, if there are 3 sequential nets named N1, N2, 
and N3, the all  value may keep only N1. Setting hdlin_keep_signal_name  to the 
value of user  and setting the keep_signal_name  directive on N1, N2, and N3 
generally keeps N1, N2, N3.
This value may cause the check_design  command to issue LINT-2 and LINT-3 
warnings:
Warning: In design '...', net '...' has no drivers.
Logic 0 assumed.  (LINT-3)
 
Warning: In design '...', net '...' driven by pin '
(no pin) ' has no loads.  (LINT-2)
all_driving
Presto attempts to preserve a signal if the signal is not removed by optimizations 
and the signal is in an output path. Only driving nets are considered. This value 
does not guarantee that a signal is kept. For signals that are not in an input path 
(do not have drivers), Presto connects the input to ground, assuming logic 0 
(ground) for the driver.

user
This value works with the keep_signal_name  directive. Presto attempts to 
preserve a signal if the signal is not removed by optimizations, and that signal 
is labeled with the keep_signal_name  directive. Dangling and driving nets are 
considered. Although not guaranteed, Presto usually keeps the specified signal 
for this configuration.
user_driving
This value works with the keep_signal_name  directive. Presto attempts to 
preserve a signal if the signal is not removed by optimizations, the signal is in an 
output path, and the signal is labeled with the keep_signal_name  directive. Only 
driving nets are considered. Although not guaranteed, Presto usually keeps the 
specified signal for this configuration. For signals that are not in an input path 
(do not have drivers), Presto connects the input to ground, assuming logic 0 
(ground) for the driver.
Examples
In Example 1, you use the hdlin_keep_signal_name  variable and the keep_signal_name 
directive to control what signals Presto attempts to preserve.
Example 1 - Verilog
 
module test (a, b, T,  A, c);
input  [3:0]   a;
input  [7:0]   b;
input T;
input A;
output reg  [7:0] c;
wire d, e;
//synopsys async_set_reset "A"
//synopsys keep_signal_name "e"
 
assign e = ( a[3] & ~a[2] &  a[1] & ~a[0] );
assign d = ( a[3] & ~a[2] &  a[1] & ~a[0] );
 
always @(T or b or A or d)
if (A)
     c = 8'h0;
       else if (T & d)
     c = b;
endmodule
The internal wire e is not kept if the line //synopsys keep_signal_name "e" is removed, and 
hdlin_keep_signal_name  is either none, user, user_driving, or all_driving. However, e is 
kept if hdlin_keep_signal_name  is all. Also, e is kept if hdlin_keep_signal_name  is user 
and //synopsys keep_signal_name is attached to "e".

In Example 2, by default Presto attempts to preserve the test1 and test2 signals because 
they are in output paths. Note that the test2 signal is not in an input path; Presto does not 
try to keep the test3 signal because it is not in an output path. Presto optimizes away the 
syn1  and syn2  signals.
Example 2 - Verilog
 
module test12 (in1, in2, in3, in4, out1,out2 );
  input  [3:0]   in1;
  input  [7:0]   in2;
  input in3;
  input in4;
  output reg  [7:0] out1,out2;
 
  wire test1,test2, test3, syn1,syn2;
 
//synopsys async_set_reset "in4"
 
  assign test1 = ( in1[3] & ~in1[2] & in1[1] & ~in1[0] );
 //test1 signal is in an input and output path
  assign test2 = syn1+syn2;
 //test2 signal is in a output path, but it is not in an input path
  assign test3 = in1 + in2;
 //test3 signal is in an input path, but it is not in an output path
  always @(in3 or in2 or in4 or test1)
  out2 = test2+out1;
  always @(in3 or in2 or in4 or test1)
      if (in4)
        out1 = 8'h0;
      else
      if (in3 & test1)
       out1 =  in2;
endmodule
One way to keep the test3 signal is to set hdlin_keep_signal_name  to user  and place the 
keep_signal_name  directive on test3, as shown in Example 3.
Example 3 - Verilog
 
module test12 (in1, in2, in3, in4, out1,out2 );
  input  [3:0]   in1;
  input  [7:0]   in2;

hdlin_module_arch_name_splitting
Controls whether Presto HDL Compiler recognizes a special format of Verilog module

Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
During an analyze  or read  command, when the hdlin_module_arch_name_splitting 
value is true, and a Verilog module name contains the special separator string "__" (two 
underscores), Presto HDL Compiler interprets the module name as specifying both a 
module and a specific architecture or implementation for that module. The portion of the 
original module name before the separator string becomes the new module name, and the 
portion after the string becomes the architecture.
For example, a module named mod__impl  would be renamed to mod  and marked as 
having architecture impl.
If hdlin_module_arch_name_splitting  is set to false  (the default), the renaming never 
occurs and modules always retain their original names. If the variable is set to true, the 
"__" is used to divide the module name into module and architecture as described above.
This capability exists to allow the creation of synthetic libraries using Verilog, with multiple 
architectures per module.

Description
This option configures the threshold for the string that characterizes the non-default 
parameters of a module instantiation during elaboration. If the parameter string length is 
less than this option value, the HDL-193  information message will show all parameters; on 
the other hand, if the string is greater, an ID will be created and associated with that set 
of parameters. The ID is numeric, incremental (starting from 1), and will be preserved for 
the same session. Consider that this feature is only enabled if hdlin_logfile_format  option 
value is equal or greater than 202409.
For example, consider the following parametrized module and a threshold of 5:
module sub #(parameter PARAM1 = 0, parameter PARAM2 = 0) ();
    initial begin
        $display("PARAM1: %d, PARAM2: %d", PARAM1, PARAM2);

        sub #(1, 2) u_sub1 ();
        sub #(.PARAM1(3), .PARAM2(4)) u_sub2 ();
    endmodule
If top  module is elaborated, u_sub1  will be instantiated with arguments "1,2", being 
a string length of 3; whereas u_sub2  will be instantiated with the argument string 
"PARAM1=3,PARAM2=4", having a size (17) that exceeds the threshold, hence, an ID is 
associated.

This variable prevents inference of a sparse multiplexer for array read operations

implementing specific switching behavior. For an array read operation, if the array size is 
not a power of 2, HDL Compiler uses a MUX_OP whose size is the next power of 2. The 
unused data inputs are disconnected. This is called a sparse multiplexer.
The hdlin_mux_for_array_read_sparseness_limit  variable guides the HDL Compiler to 
choose the right cell for an array read operation. This value corresponds to the lowest 
percentage of MUX_OP data inputs that must be connected. If the percentage is below 
this limit, HDL Compiler infers a SELECT_OP instead, whose number of data inputs does 
not need to be a power of 2, and therefore gives lower area.
The default percentage is 90. This means that if at least 90% of MUX_OP data inputs 
are connected, a MUX_OP is inferred. If this percentage is below 90%, a SELECT_OP is 
inferred instead.
The following are examples of code that will not infer a MUX_OP:
VHDL
----
signal a : bit_vector (0 to 99);
signal x: bit;
  ...
x <= a(i);
 
Verilog
-------
reg [0:99] a;
reg x;
  ...
x = a[i];
In both examples, a MUX_OP of 128 data inputs is required, but only 100 would be 
connected. This gives a percentage of 100/128*100; that is, only 78% of MUX_OP data 
inputs are connected. As this is below 90%, a SELECT_OP will be inferred.
Note that this variable prevents sparse MUX_OP inference for array read operations only. 
Inference of MUX_OP for if, case, and ?: operations is governed by the hdlin_infer_mux, 
hdlin_mux_size_limit  and hdlin_mux_oversize_ratio  variables.

  when "0010" =>   z <= data(2);

  4'b0100: z = data[1];
  4'b1000: z = data[0];
  default: z = 1'bx;
endcase
When a MUX_OP is inferred from each of the previous examples, the mux oversize ratio 
is calculated. These examples infer a 16-to-1 MUX_OP, with 4 unique data inputs. The 
oversize ratio is 4. Setting hdlin_mux_oversize_ratio  to 3 prevents either example from 
inferring a MUX_OP. A setting of 4 or greater allows these examples to infer a MUX_OP.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar hdlin_mux_oversize_ratio 
command. For a list of HDL variables and their current values, use print_variable_group

hdlin_mux_rp_limit
Limits the minimum bit width and minimum number of inputs for a relative placement 
multiplexer.
Data Types
string
Default 128x4
Description
This variable limits the minimum bit width and minimum number of inputs for a relative 
placement multiplexer.
The value is mxn  where m  is the minimum bit width and n  is the minimum number of 
inputs for the multiplexer. The default value is 128x4, meaning that HDL Compiler does not 
generate relative placement MUX_OPs for multiplexers specified with fewer than 4 inputs 
and a bit width of less than 128.
The time it takes to process a relative placement MUX is proportional to the value of 
hdlin_mux_rp_limit  squared. For example, the time it takes to process a 128x64 MUX for 
relative placement is approximately four times that for processing a 128x32 MUX.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar hdlin_mux_rp_limit 
command. For a list of HDL variables and their current values, use print_variable_group 
hdl.

Description
This variable limits the number of inputs of an inferred multiplexer. The default is value is 
32. HDL Compiler does not generate MUX_OPs for multiplexers specified with more than 
the maximum number of 32 inputs. The size of a multiplexer can be impounded by nested 
if or case statements.
The time taken to process a MUX is proportional to the value of hdlin_mux_size_limit 
squared. Extreme care must be taken when setting the limit to a figure larger than 32. If 
the design appears to hang with a limit greater than 32, lower the limit and try again. There 
is an additional, nonpractical, internal limit of 1073741824 for the size of a inferred mux.
For details, refer to the HDL Compiler for Verilog User Guide  or the HDL Compiler for 
VHDL User Guide.

hdlin_mux_size_only
Controls which MUX_OP cells receive the size_only  attribute in HDL Compiler.
Data Types
integer
Default 1
Description
To ensure that MUX_OP GTECH cells are mapped to MUX technology cells, you must 
apply a size_only  attribute to the cells to prevent logic decomposition in later optimization 
steps. Beginning with the B-2008.09-SP3 release, you can control which MUX_OP cells 
receive the size_only  attribute by using the hdlin_mux_size_only  variable. The following 
options are valid for hdlin_mux_size_only:
0
Specifies that no cells receive the size_only  attribute.
1
Specifies that all MUX_OP cells directly inferred by an RTL infer_mux  pragma 
and that are on set and reset signals receive the size_only  attribute.
2
Specifies that all MUX_OP cells directly inferred by an RTL infer_mux  pragma 
receive the size_only  attribute.
3
Specifies that all MUX_OP cells directly or indirectly inferred and that are on set 
and reset signals receive the size_only  attribute.
4
Specifies that all MUX_OP cells directly or indirectly inferred receive the 
size_only  attribute.
A MUX_OP is "directly inferred" when it results from an infer_mux  pragma applied to a 
specific RTL statement or operator.

Default none
Description
This variable instructs the elaborate  command or the read  command to retain unloaded 
sequential cells in the design. The default value is none. The following values are allowed:
none or false
No unloaded sequential cells are preserved.
all or true
All unloaded sequential cells are preserved, excluding unloaded sequential cells 
that are used solely as loop variables.
all+loop_variables or true+loop_variables
All unloaded sequential cells are preserved, including unloaded sequential cells 
that are used solely as loop variables.
ff
Only flip-flop cells are preserved, excluding unloaded sequential cells that are 
used solely as loop variables.
ff+loop_variables
Only flip-flop cells are preserved, including unloaded sequential cells that are 
used solely as loop variables.
latch
Only unloaded latch cells are preserved, excluding unloaded sequential cells 
that are used solely as loop variables.
latch+loop_variables
Only unloaded latch cells are preserved, including unloaded sequential cells that 
are used solely as loop variables.
When elaborating an RTL-level design description, HDL Compiler (Presto) infers a 
sequential cell (a latch or flip-flop) for any Verilog reg  or VHDL variable  objects that are 
conditionally assigned or are assigned under a clock edge. However, if the design never 
reads the values of these objects or never uses the values to compute any output of the 
design, the HDL Compiler (Presto) tool, by default, does not retain sequential cells for 
these objects. These sequential cells have no loads or there is no path from them to the 
outputs, and so the tool does not need them to implement the design.
You may want to preserve unnecessary sequential cells, however, to improve observability 
of the design. The hdlin_preserve_sequential  variable controls which unloaded sequential 
cells remain in the design.

The +loop_variables  option affects which sequential cells are inferred when the value of 
hdlin_preserve_sequential  is not set as false  or none, and the +loop_variables  option is 
not specified, the tool treats index variables as special and no sequential cells are inferred.
If you do not want variables treated in this special way, specify +loop_variables  for the 
variable values.
In the following example module, the bits of fail  would ordinarily not exist as sequential 
cells after elaboration of the design. However, note the following:
• If you set the value of hdlin_preserve_sequential  as all, true, or ff, the tool infers 
sequential cells for fail, and since the +loop_variables  option is not specified, the tool 
treats i  in the example as special, because i  is used only as a loop variable. Therefore, 
the tool does not infer sequential cells for i.
• If you set the value of hdlin_preserve_sequential  as all+loop_variables, true
+loop_variables, or ff+loop_variables, the tool infers sequential cells for fail, and since 
the +loop_variables  option is specified, the tool treats i  the same way as it treats all 
other variables and assigns i  to sequential cells.
• If you set the value of hdlin_preserve_sequential  as none  (the default), false, or latch, 
the tool does not assign either fail  or i  to sequential cells in the design.
Example 1:
module test (clk,rst,error);
    parameter N = 8;
    input clk,rst,error;
    reg   [N-1:0] fail;
    integer i, j;
 
    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
      if (rst)
        fail <= {N-1{1'b0}};
      else
        for ( i = 0; i < N; i = i + 1 )
          fail[i] <= fail[i] | error;
  endmodule // test
Table 1 shows how the variable settings affect the sequential cell inferring for fail  and i  in 
Example 1.
Asterisks (*) indicate that Presto infers the sequential cells.

Important: The process of elaboration might preserve unloaded sequential cells, but the 
cells are deleted by the compile  command (by default). To preserve the cells throughout 
the compile process, set the value of the compile_delete_unloaded_sequential_cells 
variable as false.
If there are other variables in your design that cause sequential elements to be inferred, 
but that you do not want in the final design, specify the preservation of sequential cells 
on a variable-by-variable basis, using the Verilog preserve_sequential  pragma in a 
declaration.
For more information on the preserve_sequential  pragma, see the HDL Compiler for 
Verilog User Guide  or the HDL Compiler for VHDL User Guide.

Chapter 1: Synthesis Variables

Feedback
Default true
Description
This variable controls whether the HDL Compiler tool issues an error or warning message 
when it finds multiple drivers of a net. The variable supports Verilog and SystemVerilog 
input formats.
Multiple drivers occur when a reg variable is driven by more than one always block or a 
wire variable is driven by more than one continuous assignment or input port and all of the 
drivers are not tristates.
Before the 2001.08 release, the tool does not issue an error message for multiple-
driver nets. After version 2001.08, the tool issues an error message by default. You 
can convert this ELAB-366 error message to an ELAB-365 warning by setting this 
variable to false. However, this setting is provided primarily for backward compatibility 
and is not recommended. You should inspect such warnings carefully. Setting the 
hdlin_prohibit_nontri_multiple_drivers  variable to false  can result in invalid designs.
In simulation, if a reg variable is driven by more than one always block, the definition 
depends on which block executed most recently. In synthesis, because all blocks are 
concurrently executing at all times, this behavior is not possible and invalid designs can 
result if the drivers are shorted together. Therefore, the tool issues an error message if any 
bits of any variables are driven by more than one process.
The Verilog standard prohibits a multiple-driven wire variable, although some simulators 
permit this behavior. The tool issues an ELAB-366 error message in this situation. If you 
want multiple-driven wire variables, set the hdlin_prohibit_nontri_multiple_drivers  variable 
to false. Note that this variable setting might cause invalid designs.
Multiple drivers are permitted on tri nets, although a warning is issued if all the drivers are 
not tristate devices.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
hdlin_prohibit_nontri_multiple_drivers  command. For a list of all HDL variables and their 
current values, use the print_variable_group hdl  command.

hdlin_report_sequential_pruning
Controls reporting about removal of tentatively inferred sequentials.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
The hdlin_report_sequential_pruning  variable lets you control whether HDL Compiler 
should issue a message when it detects that a sequential element that has already been 
tenatively inferred, but that is not actually required for proper functioning of the design 
being elaborated, is removed.
An RTL-level design description in Verilog or VHDL may contain variables for which a 
sequential cell would ordinarily be inferred (either because they are assigned under a 
clock edge, or because they are conditionally assigned) but whose values are never 
read, or whose values are not used in computing any output of the design. Because their 
values are not used (that is, they have no loads, or no path to the outputs), by default HDL 
Compiler will attempt not to infer sequential cells for these variables.
But if it does infer them, it will then try to prune them before the end of elaborate.
In some circumstances designers wish to retain these sequential cells. Unloaded 
sequential cells can be inferred by two methods. First, if hdlin_preserve_sequential 
is "all", then a sequential cell will be inferred for any variable that is conditionally 
assigned or assigned under a clock, regardless of whether its value is used or not. 
Second, if hdlin_preserve_sequential is not set, but some variables are marked with the 
"preserve_sequential" pragma, only those variables will receive sequential cells even if 
they have no loads.

This option lists System Verilog designs as interface only. HDL Compiler parses the 
module interface of the listed designs, skipping the module content, and creates a black

During elaboration, HDL compiler issues a warning message that the module content is 
discarded and ignored.

The default behavior is as described in Clause 26 of IEEE Std 1800-2012, the standard 
for SystemVerilog. Overriding the default to chain  changes how an import  statement treats 
names imported into the topmost (global) scope of a package_declaration:
• The default dont_chain  setting enforces the IEEE standard and prevents imported 
names from being re-exported to clients of the package being declared.
• The chain  setting instead re-exports names that are imported into the global scope of a 
package; they may all be imported by the intermediate package's clients. An imported 
name and its definition that are re-exported (or chained) will not collide or interfere with 
copies of themselves in those cases where several intermediate packages redistribute 
content they acquired from a common source package (provided they all acquire it from 
a compatible analyzed version of the same source file).
Example: By default, output dont_chain will get 1 and output chain will get 0, but if the 
application option is overridden to chain, then output dont_chain will get 0 and output 
chain will get 1.
package A; localparam N = 44; endpackage
package B; localparam N = 77; endpackage
package C; import B::N; endpackage
import A::*;
module VER934 import C::*; (output dont_chain, chain);
  assign dont_chain = (N == 44);
  assign chain = (N == 77);
endmodule
The analyzed result, a file named package_identifier.pvk, always contains a full copy of 
all imported content. A package's .pvk file can stand alone; it does not require its clients 
to access the .pvk files that supplied its imported ingredients (unlike source-level file 
inclusion).
The chaining issue only concerns whether imported names become explicitly visible to an 
intermediate package's clients as do objects explicitly declared at the outermost level of 
the intermediate package. Because a wildcard "import intermediate_pkg::*;" encumbers all 
of the exportable names found in "intermediate_pkg", the selection of chain  or dont_chain 
can alter the outcome of name resolutions when several packages are combined in a 
downstream client.
The setting of hdlin_sv_packages  at the time a package is analyzed is compiled into 
a visibility property on the imported, global names in the resulting .pvk file. This is an 
independent property that can be different at each level of a supply chain; it is not an 
inherited property of the name itself. A VER-934 informational message always indicates 
how this property is being set for those names where it might eventually matter.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the report_app_var hdlin_sv_packages 
command. For a list of HDL variables and their current values, use print_variable_group 
hdl.

hdlin_sv_tokens
Specifies whether a tokens file should be written out during the analysis of SystemVerilog 
designs.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
When hdlin_sv_tokens  is turned on, the lexical tokens that are sent to the parser during 
analysis of a SystemVerilog design (such as with an analyze -f sverilog  or a read_sverilog 
command) will also be saved to an output file in the work directory.
When using complex macros or nested conditional compilation directives, it might help to 
see what the actual RTL will be after preprocessing, for example, to understand a syntax 
error.
When the value of hdlin_sv_tokens  is overridden and set to true, an expanded version 
of the source files is written to an output file tokens.n{n}.sv, instead of being sent to the 
parser. In the output file, conditional compilation directives will already have been taken 
into account and all macro invocations will already have been expanded. The first tokens 
file written out in a particular work directory will be tokens.1.sv, the next tokens.2.sv, the 
next tokens.3.sv, and so on.
Although the output file is legal SystemVerilog, it is formatted in a way that is intended to 
be conveniently human readable, by using standard line directives to indicate the original 
source files and line numbers. This makes it relatively easy to track down the source of an 
error using the file name and line number in the error message. For example, if the error 
message refers to line 321 of the file "my_file.sv", then look for line 321 "my_file.sv"  in the 
output file.
The only comments preserved are those that are sent to the parser, because they are in 
more than mere comments, such as synthesis pragmas and embedded scripts.

Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Group
hdl_variables
Description
By default, the tool uses simple names for elements inferred from unions in SystemVerilog. 
Setting this variable to true  enables the tool to use the name of the first union member 
as a reference for the port, net, and cell names associated with the union data type. For 
example,
1 typedef union packed {
  2   byte        field1;
  3   logic [7:0] field2;
  4 } packet;
  5
  6 module test (input packet p1, output packet p2, input clk);
  7   always_ff @ (posedge clk)
  8     p2.field1 = p1.field2;
  9 endmodule
When you set this variable to false, the following names are inferred:
Ports and nets: p1[7], p1[6], ..., p1[0]
    Cells: p2_reg[7], p2_reg[6], ..., p2_reg[0]
When you set this variable to true, the following names are inferred:
Ports and nets: p1[field1][7], p1[field1][6], ..., p1[field1][0]

to be used as one language, so merging the base Verilog language and the SystemVerilog 
extensions into a single standard provides all information regarding syntax and semantics

Enabling this application variable (default is true) brings the tool into alignment with

surrounding macro arguments will be removed unless that whitespace closes an escaped 
identifier.
For example, unless this application variable is enabled, analyzing the following RTL:
module top(output test_bit);

be zero, but, instead of issuing an error, HDL Compiler would implement {0{expression}} 
as 1'b0, regardless of the size or value of the second operand. By default, the tool now 
implements a zero replication constant according to the rules of Verilog-2005, even if 
the Verilog standard is overridden back to 1995 or 2001, in which case overriding this 
variable to false  restores the older behavior. Overriding this variable has no effect when 
the standard is 2005. Because the older style of implementing a non-standard zero 
replication constant is likely to mismatch with simulation, an ELAB-364 warning is issued 
when it happens.

hier_dont_trace_ungroup
Disables ungroup tracing set on the design with the ungroup  command.
Data Types
Boolean
Default 0
Description
This variable disables ungroup tracing set on the design with the ungroup  command. 
When hier_dont_trace_ungroup  is set to 0  (the default), the ungroup  command places 
on the design being ungrouped a string attribute that describes the ungroup operation. 
Other tools (for example, RTL Analyzer) can later use the attribute to recreate the ungroup 
operation and trace between the mapped and GTECH (generic) circuits.
Setting hier_dont_trace_ungroup  to 1  disables ungroup tracing and can increase the 
efficiency of ungroup  and other commands.

Default 1
Description
This variable specifies the pin capacitance to use for computing the loading of high-fanout 
nets.
The tool computes the pin capacitance for high-fanout nets by multiplying the capacitance 
specified with the high_fanout_net_pin_capacitance  variable times the high-fanout 
threshold.
For best results, you should specify a large value for the pin capacitance to cause 
violations on all constrained high-fanout nets. This forces the tool to replace the nets with 
buffer trees during compilation.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
high_fanout_net_pin_capacitance  variable. For a list of all timing variables and their 
current values, use the print_variable_group timing  variable.

high_fanout_net_threshold
high_fanout_net_threshold

Data Types
integer
Default 1000
Description
This variable specifies the minimum number of loads for a net to be classified as a high-
fanout net.
Delays and loads of high-fanout are computed using a simplified model assuming a fixed 
fanout number. The rationale behind this is that delays of high-fanout nets are expensive 
to compute but such nets are often unconstrained (as in the case of global reset nets, 
scan enable nets, and so on). Those high-fanout nets that actually are constrained should 
eventually be replaced by buffer trees. So detailed delay calculations on such nets are 
expensive and usually unnecessary.
Setting the threshold to 0 (or to a very large number) ensures that no nets will be treated 
as high-fanout nets. However, be aware that forcing fully accurate delay calculations on 
high-fanout can significantly increase compilation runtime in some cases.

The pin capacitance for high-fanout nets is computed by multiplying the capacitance 
specified by the high_fanout_net_pin_capacitance  variable times the high-fanout threshold 
plus the number of net drivers. If there are delay annotations remaining from an earlier 
flow step, these annotations will be used instead of the high-fanout net model.
The simplified net delay model is used only when computing data delays. Propagated 
clock latencies are always computed using the full accuracy net delay model.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar high_fanout_net_threshold

Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
This variable controls how clock skew calculations handle the input delay on clocks.
Normally, you should use the set_input_delay  command only on data ports, and use the 
set_clock_latency  command on clock ports. In cases where the set_input_delay  command 
has been used on a clock port, the default behavior differs between PrimeTime and the 
synthesis timing engine used by Design Compiler and IC Compiler.
By default (false), the synthesis timing engine uses the input delay values set on the 
clocks with the set_input_delay  command when computing the skew values.
When set to true, the synthesis timing engine ignores the input delay values set on the 
clocks with the set_input_delay  command when computing the skew values of clocked 
registers, which is compatible with the default PrimeTime behavior.
Set this variable to true  when correlating synthesis and Primetime results.

insert_test_design_naming_style
Specifies how the insert_dft  command names new designs created during the addition of

Data Types
string
Default %s_test_%d
Description
This variable specifies how the insert_dft  command names new designs created during 
the addition of test circuitry. When insert_dft  modifies a design by adding test circuitry, it 
creates the design with a new, unique name. The new name is derived from the original 
design name and the format specified by this variable.
This variable must contain only one %s (percent s) and %d (percent d) character 
sequence. The percent sign has special meaning in the formatting process. To use a 
percent sign in the design name, two are needed in the variable setting (%%).
When insert_dft  generates a new design name, it replaces %s with the original design 
name and %d with an integer. The integer is one that ensures the new name is unique. A 
single percent sign is substituted for %%.
For example, if this variable is set to %s_test_%d, and the original design name is 
my_design, the new design name is my_design_test_1.
If the insert_dft  command is repeated (for example, with a different test methodology), the 
new design name is my_design_test_2.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
insert_test_design_naming_style  command. For a list of insert_dft  variables and their 
current values, use print_variable_group insert_dft.

capabilities of the back-end tools being used. Ideally the back-end tool is able to support 
putting the new cells exactly where the reoptimize_design  command wants them to go. If

mv
Description
This variable, when set to true  (the default), allows the tool to accept design data 
containing inconsistencies or errors that would otherwise prevent completion of tasks in 
the tool.
A true  setting allows inconsistent data in the following ways:
• mv_no_main_power_violations  variable: behavior as if set to false (irrespective of 
actual setting)
• mv_use_std_cell_for_isolation  variable: behavior as if set to true (irrespective of actual 
setting)
• link  command allows selection of cells with PVT parameters that fail to meet 
requirements
When this variable is set to false, each individual feature is controlled by the setting of the 
feature-specific variable, and the link  command requires PVT parameters to be correct.

By default, the reference and the design cells to be linked are checked to ascertain the 
alphabet-case matching policy of the HDL input format that created that particular cell. 
Then, the least-sensitive matching rule is applied to determine whether the design cell 
resolves the reference. For example, a VHDL reference is linked case-insensitively 
and a Verilog reference is linked case-sensitively, while mixed language linkage 
candidates match case-insensitively. To override this behavior, you can set the value of the 
link_force_case  variable to either case_sensitive  or case_insensitive.
The appropriate matching policy applies to all the HDL identifiers that must be matched by 
the link: design template, port, and parameter names. It does not apply to the (canonical 
forms of) data values in any parameter override, which (for string data) are always case-
sensitive. It also does not apply to library and architecture identifiers, which are always 
case-insensitive. When link candidates are built by elaboration, case-forcing does not 
change the HDL identifiers of the design or reference cells that are built.
Setting this variable to either the case_sensitive  or the case_insensitive  value can lead to 
results which are inconsistent with the default rules, since a forced rule applies throughout 
the linked hierarchy.
To determine the value of this variable, use the printvar link_force_case  command.

link_library
Specifies the list of design files and libraries used during linking.
Data Types
list
Default * your_library.db
Description
This variable specifies the list of design files and libraries used during linking. The link 
command looks at the files and tries to resolve references in the order of the specified 
files. A "*" entry in the value of this variable indicates that the link  command is to search 
all the designs loaded in dc_shell while trying to resolve references. If file names do not 
include directory names, files are searched for in the directories in search_path. The 
default is {"*" your_library.db}. Change your_library.db  to reflect your library name.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar link_library  command. For 
a list of all system variables and their current values, use the print_variable_group system 
command.

link_portname_allow_period_to_match_underscore
Enables the linker to allow a period (.) as an alternative to an underscore (_) when doing 
port name matching.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
During linking, if named port mapping is used in the cell instance statement, the linker 
resolves port connections based on the port names. If the linker is unable to find a 
matching port name, and the link_portname_allow_period_to_match_underscore  variable 
is set to true, the linker replaces, for comparison purposes, the "." characters in the port 
name from the cell instance statement with the "_" character to see if there is a match. 
This variable has no effect when positional port mapping is used instead.
The following Verilog example shows the effect of this variable on the link  command:
module top ( B , A, Y);
      input A,B;
      output Y;
      wire Y;
      mid mid1 (.\\B.X (B), .A(A), .Y(Y));
    endmodule
 
    module mid (B_X, A, Y);
      input B_X;
      input A;
      output Y;
      assign Y = B_X & A;
    endmodule
The following scenarios assume that you have already read in the Verilog file and are 
running the link  command.
Scenario 1:
link_portname_allow_period_to_match_underscore  set to false
The linker attempts to resolve the port connections but is unable to find a port with the 
name "B.X" in the port list of the mid design. This causes the linker to issue a LINK-1 error.

Error: Can't find inout port 'B.X' on reference to 'mid' in 'top'. 
 (LINK-1)
This is expected because the instantiation of mid1 uses B.X as the port name but the 
actual port name is B_X.
Scenario 2:
link_portname_allow_period_to_match_underscore  set to true
The linker first attempts to resolve the port connections but fails to resolve 
the "B.X" port name as in the previous scenario. However, since the 
link_portname_allow_period_to_match_underscore  variable is set to true, the linker takes 
"B.X" and replaces all '.' characters with the '_' character. For this comparison, the linker 
will compare "B_X" against "B_X". In this case, the port names match and the design links 
successfully.

link_portname_allow_square_bracket_to_match_underscore
Enables the linker to allow a square bracket([]) as an alternative to an underscore (_) 
when doing port name matching.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
During linking, the linker resolves port connections based on port names 
when named port mapping is used in cell instantiation. In the default 
mode, the linker looks for an exact match of the port names. Setting the 
link_portname_allow_square_bracket_to_match_underscore  variable to true, allows the 
linker to also match the "[]" characters with the "_" character. This variable has no effect 
when positional port mapping is used. This variable should be used only for matching 
modport arrays.
The following SystemVerilog example shows the effect of this variable on 
the link  command. Note -  this example requires another related variable 
link_portname_allow_period_to_match_underscore  to also be set to true. This is because 
this example contains both "[]" and "." characters in the original portname.

The following scenarios assume that you have already read in the SystemVerilog file and 
are running the link  command.
Scenario 1:
link_portname_allow_square_bracket_to_match_underscore  set to false
link_portname_allow_period_to_match_underscore  set to false
The linker attempts to resolve the port connections but is unable to find a port with the 
name "aa_master[0].valid" in the port list of the subblk design. This causes the linker to 
issue a LINK-1 error.
Error: Can't find inout port 'aa_master[0].valid' on reference to 
 'subblk' in 'top'. (LINK-1)
This is expected because the instantiation of 'subblk' uses 'aa_master[0].valid' as the port 
name but the actual port name is 'aa_master_0__valid'.
Scenario 2:
link_portname_allow_square_bracket_to_match_underscore  set to true
link_portname_allow_period_to_match_underscore  set to true
The linker now matches all '.', and '[]' characters with the '_' character, and 
"aa_master[0].valid" matches "aa_master_0__valid", and the design links successfully.

Description
This variable controls how aggressively the multicorner-multimode scenario reduction 
feature reduces the number of dominant scenarios.
By default, any scenario with a violation that is worst across all scenarios is included 
in the dominant set of scenarios. As you increase the value of this variable, scenario 
reduction adjusts its criteria for comparing the slack of a violating object across different 
scenarios. This allows for further reduction of the dominant scenario set, but implies that a 
few violations will not be fixed during optimization.
If you set this variable to a value smaller than 0, scenario reduction is performed using 
an effort level of 0. If you set this variable to a value larger than 10, scenario reduction is 
performed using an effort level of 10.

scenario reduction.

This variable controls whether or not to allow level-shifter insertion on leaf pin boundaries 
that are not power domain boundaries. For example, When a macro cell is operating at 
a voltage different from its surrounding logic, and you want level shifters to be inserted at 
the interface, the recommended flow is to define a power domain around the macro cell by 
specifying the macro cell as the root cell of a power domain.
If you do not define the macro cell as the root cell, level shifters are not inserted at the 
interface, because the interface is not a power domain boundary. By default, level shifters 
are only inserted at power domain boundaries.
If you are unable to define a power domain around the macro cell, but still require level 
shifters to be inserted, or if you need level shifters at the interface of any kind of leaf cell, 
use this variable to enable the non-default behavior.

By default, the variable is set to true, which allows the primary supplies of a power 
domain to be used for buffering always-on feedthrough nets, as long as doing so does not 
introduce electrical violations. Buffers ordinarily used in the power domain are used as 
much as possible to get the best possible QoR.
If the variable is set to false, feedthrough nets are marked as always-on nets with the 
related supply from driver or loads, requiring that any buffers used on the feedthrough net 
be compatible with the driver or load domains. This option is provided mainly for backward

The driver pins with nets falling within the following range are considered for via ladder 
insertion during optimization:
[WNS, WNS*(1-optimize_via_ladder_critical_range)]
By default, the variable is set to 0.5. Therefore, if the worst negative slack is -1000, the

Description
This variable controls the treatment of channel areas during coarse placement.
Valid values are auto, true, or false.
By default (false), the tool does not treat channel areas differently.
When you set this variable to true, the tool analyzes the area available for placement and 
classifies narrow parts as channels. The tool reduces the maximum cell density allowed in 
channel areas during coarse placement to help reduce congestion.
When you set this variable to auto, the tool considers the amount of channel area in the 
design. If the tool determines that the design has little or no channel area, it does not treat 
channel areas differently. If the tool determines that the design has a substantial amount of 
channel area, it reduces the maximum cell density allowed in channel areas during coarse 
placement to help reduce congestion.
Some increase in runtime and memory usage is expected when this feature is active. 
Setting this variable to auto  only incurs the runtime and memory penalties when the design

Description
The gated-clock method reduces a design's power consumption by controlling the 
switching activity from the clock signal to flip-flop registers. The automatic bound 
function works only for the gated-clock elements created by Power Compiler. The 
placer_gated_register_area_multiplier  variable does not affect your design unless you use 
the clock-gating functionality of Power Compiler.
To reduce clock skew, place the clock-gating element and the flip-flops it controls close 
together in your design. The tool automatically creates a floating group bound for each 
clock-gating element and the flip-flops the element drives. This group bound helps place 
the flip-flops closer to the clock-gating element.
The size of the group bound is equal to the square root of the product of the total area 
of flip-flop elements the gate controls within the group bound and the value of the 
placer_gated_register_area_multiplier  variable.
For example, if a clock-gating element drives five flip-flops and the total area of these six 
cells is 45, the size of the group bound is sqrt(20 x 45) = 30.

such paths. This variable controls the depth limit for the checking.
When running the placer, no path may be deeper than this limit. This applies even if the 
path is unconstrained.

If this variable is set above 32767, however, two things will happen: 1) Depth checking will 
be disabled. 2) Multicore operation will be disabled.
Be aware that increasing this limit may cause the process to abort due to insufficient stack 
space. Always set the process stack size to a high value in your system command shell 
when using this option.
An alternative to changing this limit is to use set_disable_timing to break very long 
paths into multiple segments. The paths must be broken up so than no segment (even if 
unconstrained) is longer than the limit.
placer_max_cell_density_threshold
Enables a mode of coarse placement in which cells can clump together.
Data Types
float
Default Variable is not supported in Design Compiler non-topographical mode and 
Design Compiler NXT non-topographical mode
-1 in Design Compiler topographical mode, DC Explorer, and Design Compiler NXT 
topographical mode
Description
This variable enables a mode of coarse placement in which cells are not distributed evenly 
across the surface of the chip and are allowed to clump together.
The value you specify sets the threshold for how tightly the cells are allowed to clump. A 
value of 1.0 does not allow gaps between cells.
A reasonable value is one that is above the background utilization of your design but 
below 1.0. For example, if your background utilization is 40%, or 0.4, a reasonable value 
for this variable is a value between 0.4 and 1.0. The higher the value, the more tightly the 
cells clump together.
You can use this feature in Design Compiler topographical mode. It affects the virtual 
layout in the compile_ultra  flow.
For example, to set the threshold to 0.7, enter

Description
This variable can reduce the number of cores used for running the placement engine 
when you have previously enabled multicore processing by running the set_host_options 
-max_cores  command.
If the variable is set to 0 (the default value), the maximum number of cores used by the 
placement engine is specified by the set_host_options -max_cores  command.
If the variable is set to 1, the placement engine runs in single-core mode, regardless of the 
number of cores specified by the set_host_options -max_cores  command.
If the variable is set to a value greater than 1 and smaller than the value specified by the 
set_host_options -max_cores  command, the placement engine ignores the value set by 
the set_host_options  command and runs in multicore mode with the number of cores 
specified by the variable.
If the variable is set to a value greater than the value specified by the set_host_options 
-max_cores  command, this variable is ignored.
This variable should not be used for normal operation and is primarily intended for 
diagnostic purposes.
Examples
The following example enables multicore processing with a maximum of four cores for all 
multicore functions.
prompt> set_host_options -max_cores 4

Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
When this variable is set to true, clock gates inserted by Power Compiler are automatically 
identified. Identification refers to the process of detecting clock gates and the 
corresponding gated element association, and setting different attributes on these objects. 
These attributes enable the subsequent steps in the tool to work efficiently. Set this 
variable with the read_verilog  command before reading the input RTL file.
Clock gate identification is required when a netlist is passed in ASCII format. This is not 
required if a binary database (such as in .ddc format or MilkyWay) is used to transfer 
design data between tool invocations.
By using the automatic identification method, each time a command that works on clock-
gating circuitry is called, identification is performed. This ensures that the command makes 
use of the current clock-gating configuration of the design.
In order to be identified, the gate clock must meet the following conditions:
• Be connected to a clock net through its clock pin
• All its gated registers are gated through the clock pin
• All its gated registers are activated by the same edge of the clock
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar power_cg_auto_identify

This variable reduces the unevenness in the number of stages of clock gates feeding 
different register banks. When this variable is set to true, the compile -gate_clock  or 
compile_ultra -gate_clock  command reconfigures the different stages of clock gates so 
that there is exactly the same number of clock gates in each path from the clock root 
to the clock pin of all gatable register banks. It is necessary to define clocks using the 
create_clock  command for each clock network where clock gates need to be reconfigured.
Only the tool-inserted clock gates and integrated clock gating (ICG) cells are considered 
during stage balancing.
A clock-gating cell is not modified or removed if it or its parent hierarchical cell is marked 
as dont_touch  with the set_dont_touch  command; it will not be affected by clock gate 
stage balancing.

Description
For latch-free clock gate insertion with the insert_clock_gating  command, the setup 
condition must be met before a bank can be clock gated. This implies that the enable 
condition of the bank must be combinationally dependent on nets that are known to be 
synchronous (such as, belong to the same clock domain) with the registers of the bank 
that are being clock gated.
The clock domain of nets is determined by the registers withing the module (subdesign) 
that drive the nets and the clock relationship specified for ports with the set_input_delay 
command. By default, the clock domain relationship is analyzed within the module. 
This is to ensure that clock gating on subdesigns is context independent. If a module is 
instantiated from a design different than the current design, the clock-gating result will still 
be correct.
If the non-combinational driver (register or top-level port) of an input to a module exists 
outside of that module, the clock domain of that input is considered unknown and no latch-
free clock gating can be performed with enable conditions that depend on that particular 
input.
The setup condition can be relaxed to perform context specific analysis of the clock 
domain relationship. This is achieved by setting the power_cg_derive_related_clock 
variable to true. In that case, the clock domain of any net will be derived from the non-
combinational drivers in the (hierarchical) fanin of the net.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar

Description
This variable controls whether external feedback loops should be used to generate the

When this variable is set to false, registers with their enable pin tied to logic 1 are 
discarded as candidates to be clock gated.

This variable specifies to different ungroup  commands whether or not to flatten

during any ungroup step. To flatten the clock gating cells, set the value to true  before using 
the ungroup  command or any other ungrouping steps listed above.
In normal usage, ungrouping the clock gates is not recommended. Ungrouping the clock 
gates before compile could have serious side effects. For example, ungrouped clock gates 
cannot be mapped to integrated clock-gating cells. Power Compiler commands such as 
report_clock_gating, remove_clock_gating, and rewire_clock_gating  assume that the 
clock gates have a hierarchy of their own. Also, the tool's placement of clock gates and 
registers may not be optimal when clock gating cells are flattened. Flattened clock gates 
are supported when using integrated clock-gating cells, provided the flattening is done 
only after compile.

Description
This variable controls the effort level used by compile_ultra [-incremental] -gate_clock  to

variable power_cg_high_effort_enable_fanin_analysis  is set to true.
This analysis checks if the fanin of the data or enable pin of the gated register, or enable 
pin of the gated clock-gating cells, can be rewired. Rewiring will change the input logic of a 
register, or clock-gating cell, given that its gating cell is active. This effects the effort level 
to avoid having shared logic between the input pins of the registers, or clock-gating cells, 
and its gating cells. If this rewiring is not possible, then the input logic of the gated cells is 
not changed. When setting the effort level to high, more runtime is used when performing 
this analysis.
This analysis, regardless of effort level, will not:
• Cross hierarchical boundaries
• Affect shift registers or multibit registers
Please note that this analysis is only performed upon the gated cells.

Description
This variable ignores the setup condition for latch-free clock gating. For latch-free clock

before a bank can be clock gated. This implies that the enable condition of the bank must 
be combinationally dependent on nets that are known to be synchronous (belong to the 
same clock domain) with the registers of the bank that are being clock gated.
The setup condition can be ignored during latch-free clock gating. This is achieved by 
setting the power_cg_ignore_setup_condition  variable to true. This is generally not 
safe, since latch-free clock gating of a bank with an enable that is not synchronous to 
the registers of that bank can lead to problems on the clock net. In this case it is the 
responsibility of the designer to ensure that the result after clock gating is functionally 
correct.

• Only cell level exceptions are inherited. This means that all synchronous pins of a 
register must have the same set of timing exceptions before this can be inferred onto a 
clock gate.
• If a set of registers with the same enable conditions has different timing exceptions 
among them, then this is split into a smaller set of registers with homogeneous 
exceptions before clock gate insertion. This might create small banks that fall below the 
minimum bit width specified for clock gating and so they may remain ungated.

Allows negedge ICGs to gate posedge registers, and posedge ICGs to gate negedge 
registers during compile [-incremental_mapping] -gate_clock  or compile_ultra 
[-incremental_mapping] -gate_clock.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
Allows negedge ICGs to gate posedge registers, and posedge ICGs to gate negedge 
registers during compile_ultra -gate_clock  or compile -gate_clock. You can only use this 
feature if the power_cg_permit_opposite_edge_icg  variable is set to true  before using the 
set_clock_gating_style  command.
This feature is useful when you are restricted from using either posedge or negedge ICGs. 
Cell selection might be restricted because the appropriate cell is not in your target library 
or your cells are constrained by a dont_use attribute.
This transformation is ensured by adding an inverter in the fan-in and another one in the 
fan-out of the ICG.

power_cg_physically_aware_cg
Enables the restructuring of the integrated clock-gating cell and the registers in the 
Synopsys physical guidance flow to provide better convergence on clock gating timing 
paths against postCTS results.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
Set this variable to true to enable the restructuring of the integrated clock-gating cell and 
the registers in the Synopsys physical guidance flow to provide better convergence on 
clock gating timing paths against postCTS results. Enabling this setting can degrade 
power and is hence recommended only if clock gating timing paths are expected to 
become critical during CTS.
The tool restructures the connection between the integrated clock-gating cell and the 
registers that it drives so that each clock-gating cell is physically close to the registers 
gated by the clock-gating cell.
Right before the restructuring process, and independent of the current setting of the 
variable power_cg_auto_identify, clock gating identification is performed.
Clock gates with high fanouts are split according to physical location of their gated 
registers. This placement is maintained throughout the implementation flow.
During the split operation, the user defined integrated clock-gating cell, specified by the 
set_clock_gating_style  command, could be replaced by a better cell based on drive-
strength characteristics. To prevent the using specific integrated clock-gating exclude them 
with the set_dont_use -power  command.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
power_cg_physically_aware_cg  command. For a list of power variables and their current 
values, use the print_variable_group power  command.
When this variable is enabled, the annotation of latency values from the 
set_clock_gate_latency  command is disabled and the apply_clock_gate_latency  command 
is also disabled.

power_cg_print_enable_conditions
Reports the enable conditions of registers and clock gates during clock gate insertion.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
This variable prints the enable conditions of clock gates and registers when performing 
automatic RTL clock gate insertion with the insert_clock_gating  command. The report 
is useful for debugging purposes and to achieve a better understanding of the design 
structure and functionality.
The enable condition of a register or clock gate is a combinational function of nets in the 
design. As such, enable conditions can be represented by Boolean expressions of nets. 
The enable condition of a register represents the states for which a clock signal must be 
passed to the register. The enable condition of a clock gate corresponds to the states 
for which a clock will be passed to the registers in the fanout of the clock gate. The tool 
utilizes the enable condition of the registers for clock gate insertion.
To enable reporting of the enable conditions during clock gating, set 
power_cg_print_enable_conditions  to true  before issuing the insert_clock_gating 
command.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
power_cg_print_enable_conditions  command. For a list of power variables and their 
current values, use print_variable_group power.

power_cg_print_enable_conditions_max_terms
Specifies the maximum number of product terms to be reported in the sum of product 
expansion of the enable condition.
Data Types
integer
Default 10
Description
This variable specifies the maximum number of product terms to be reported in the sum 
of product expansion of the enable condition. For debugging purposes and to achieve a 
better understanding of the design structure and functionality it can be useful to print the 
enable conditions of clock gates and registers when performing automatic RTL clock gate 
insertion with the insert_clock_gating  command.
The enable conditions are reported as a sum of product expression. Since for complex 
expressions such a representation is known to grow very large, the maximum number of 
product terms is limited by the power_cg_print_enable_conditions_max_terms  variable. 
By default, at most 10 product terms are printed. If the actual number of product terms 
exceeds this limit, the enable condition is reported as "?? (too many product terms)". 
If necessary, the number of product terms to be shown can be increased by setting 
power_cg_print_enable_conditions_max_terms  to a larger value.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
power_cg_print_enable_conditions_max_terms  command. For a list of power variables 
and their current values, use print_variable_group power.

Description
This variable controls whether reconfigurations are performed during compile_ultra 
-gate_clock  or compile -gate_clock. The reconfigurations are performed only if the 
power_cg_reconfig_stages  variable is set to true.
Multistage reconfiguration involves the addition or reduction of stages of clock gates. You 
specify the maximum permissible number of stages of clock gates in the design using 
the set_clock_gating_style -num_stages  command. A clock gate stage is added when a 
common enable condition can be factored out of many clock gates without violating the 
maximum stages specified. A clock gate stage is reduced if the design has more stages 
than what is specified.
Also, it is necessary to define clocks using the create_clock  command for each clock 
network where clock gates need to be reconfigured.
Only the tool-inserted clock gates and integrated clock-gating (ICG) cells can be 
reconfigured.
A clock-gating cell is not modified or removed if it or its parent hierarchical cell is marked 
dont_touch  with the set_dont_touch  command; it will not be affected by multistage 
reconfiguration.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar power_cg_reconfig_stages 
command.

The power_enable_power_gating  variable enables and disables the power gating flow 
during compile  and physopt  command activity.
Retention registers are the registers that can save the values of the registers and restore 
them later. Retention registers might have different styles. The power_gating_cell  cell-level 
attributes in target libraries are used to specify the styles.
To allow only the retention registers with certain types used for the specified sequential 
elements during compile, set the power_enable_power_gating  variable to true.
The command requires a Power Compiler license during compile, otherwise Design 
Compiler cannot handle retention registers correctly. If the variable is true, it also prevents 
the compile  and physopt  commands from swapping the retention registers back to regular 
sequential elements.

is used.
Data Types
Boolean
Default true in Design Compiler non-topographical mode, Design Compiler

Variable is not supported in DC Explorer
Description
This variable specifies whether the tool modifies the user-annotated state-dependent 
and/or path-dependent (SDPD) switching activity to fix any inconsistencies before they 
are used. The accuracy of switching activity annotation, including the SDPD annotation, 
affects the accuracy of power calculation, and when this variable is set the tool checks the 
SDPD annotation for inconsistencies. The SDPD annotation is automatically modified to fix 
any inconsistencies found.

In most cases, some inconsistencies are created during normal switching activity flows, 
and the SDPD fixing step modifies the SDPD annotation slightly to improve the power 
estimation accuracy. For example, during SAIF generation using a simulator, the total of 
rise and fall toggle on a pin may be different, when perhaps an odd number of toggles are 
captured. In this case, the SDPD fixing step scales the SDPD toggle rate annotations so 
that the rise and fall totals are the same.
Setting this variable to false  disables the SDPD fixing step.
Setting the power_fix_sdpd_annotation_verbose  variable to true  makes the SDPD fixing 
step issue verbose messages when user annotated switching activity is modified.
The following checks and modifications are performed during the SDPD fixing step:
• False states (states that always evaluate to 0, including the default state on cells 
whose other states cover all possible states) with non-zero state-dependent (SD) static 
probabilities have their static probability set to 0.0.
• Unannotated false states on cells with partially annotated SD static probabilities are 
automatically annotated with 0.0.
• Cells with fully annotated SD static probabilities have their static probabilities scaled so 
that they add up to 1.0.
• Cells with partially annotated SD static probabilities that add up to more than 1.0 have 
their static probabilities scaled down so that they add up to 1.0. On such cells, an SD 
static probability of 0.0 is set on the unannotated states.
• False states and arcs with non-zero state-dependent and/or path-dependent (SDPD) 
toggle rates have their toggle rate set to 0.0.
• Unannotated false states/arcs on pins with partially annotated SDPD toggle rates are 
automatically annotated with 0.0.
• Pins with fully annotated SDPD toggle rates have their toggle rates scaled so that they 
add up to the non-SDPD toggle rate of the pin (that is, the non-SDPD toggle rate on the 
net connected to the pin).
• Pins with partially annotated SDPD toggle rates that add up to more than the pin toggle 
rate have their SDPD toggle rates scaled down so that they add up to the non-SDPD 
toggle rate. On such pins, an SDPD toggle rate of 0.0 is set on the unannotated states 
and arcs.
• Pins with partially annotated SDPD toggle rates have their toggle rates scaled so that 
the totals of rise and fall SDPD toggle rates are equal.
• The sum of the SDPD toggle rates on pins with fully annotated SDPD toggle rate 
information is annotated as the non-SDPD pin toggle rate (that is, the total toggle rate 
of the net connected to the pin) if this was not previously annotated.

Data Types
Boolean
Default false in Design Compiler non-topographical mode, Design Compiler

Variable is not supported in DC Explorer
Description
This variable, when set to true  specifies that the insert_clock_gating  command will 
not split clock-gating cells to limit their fanout. By default, insert_clock_gating  splits 
clock-gating cells to limit their fanout. This activity is based on the value specified by 
the set_clock_gating_style -max_fanout  command, whose default is unlimited. When 
true, insert_clock_gating  does not split clock-gating cells, resulting in a netlist where all 
registers are gated by a single clock-gating cell if they share the same enable signal. 
Also, insert_clock_gating  does not honor the value specified by set_clock_gating_style 
-max_fanout.
Set the variable to true  if your clock-tree synthesis (CTS) tool inserts buffers after 
the clock-gating cell. In this case, the fanout of the clock-gating cell is limited to the 
buffers inserted by the CTS tool. This information is not available in the design while the 
insert_clock_gating  command is performing RTL clock gating. When you set this variable 
to true, insert_clock_gating  does not split the load of the clock-gating cells (by duplicating 
the cells) to save area and power.

When this variable is set to true, the lib2saif  command generates forward SAIF files 
with directives to generate separate rise and fall values for non-state-dependent path-
dependent toggle counts.
When this variable is set to false, directives to generate just the total of the rise and fall 
values for non-state-dependent path-dependent toggle counts are generated.
For more accurate power calculations, use separate rise and fall toggle counts; however, 
older simulators and simulation interfaces may not recognize such directives and will fail to 
read the library forward SAIF file. The Synopsys SAIF generation PLI utility provided with 
Power Compiler X-2005.09 supports directives for separate rise and fall values for path-
dependent toggle rates, but older versions of the utility do not.
Note that this variable affects only directives for path-dependent toggle counts that are 
not state-dependent. Whether this variable is set to true or false, directives for separate 
rise and fall values are generated for state-dependent and both state and path-dependent 
toggle counts.

are connected by such nets. This tends to reduce the total switching power of the design.
To be effective, you should annotate switching activity information on the netlist using the 
read_saif  command before the compile operation. If the netlist is partially annotated, the 
tool performs switching activity propagation to estimate switching activity on all nets and 
pins of the design, before low-power placement.
Low-power placement is a dynamic power reduction technique that uses advanced 
placement features only available in the -spg  mode of the compile_ultra  command. To 
enable and use low-power placement:
• Set the power_low_power_placement  variable to true
• Enable dynamic power optimization. In a multicorner-multimode design, use the 
set_scenario_options -dynamic_power true  command. In a non-multicorner-multimode

Description
When you set the psynopt_tns_high_effort  variable to true, preroute commands, such as 
place_opt, clock_opt, and psynopt  use high-effort optimization strategies to improve total 
negative slack (TNS). This variable is not enabled by default because it increases runtime. 
Set the variable to true if further TNS optimization is required.

Description
This variable enables the use of slew degradation during the RCCALC-009 condition. 
When set to false, (the default), slew degradation through RC networks is not used in 
minimum analysis mode during the RCCALC-009 condition.
The "RCCALC-009 condition" means a condition in which timing analysis checks the 
library-derived drive resistance, and if it is less than the dynamic RC network impedance 
to ground by an amount equal to or greater than the value of a particular drive-strength 
threshold, timing analysis adjusts the drive resistance using an empirical formula to 
improve accuracy, and issues the RCCALC-009 message. If this improved accuracy is 
not sufficient, timing analysis provides extra pessimism by not using slew degradation in 
minimum analysis mode; however, unnecessary minimum delay violations could occur as 
a side effect. You can keep slew degradation on in minimum analysis mode after you have 
qualified the RCCALC-009 methodology for your accuracy requirements, by setting this 
variable to true.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
rc_degrade_min_slew_when_rd_less_than_rnet  or echo 
$rc_degrade_min_slew_when_rd_less_than_rnet  command.

Description
This variable specifies whether the timing engine uses a basic or advanced driver model 
for RC delay calculation. The basic  model is derived from a simpler delay and slew library 
method, whereas the advanced  model is derived from an advanced driver model that is 
part of the Synopsys Composite Current Source (CCS) model.
When the variable is set to basic, RC delay calculation always uses driver models derived 
from the conventional delay and slew model present in the design library. When it is set to 
advanced  (the default), RC delay calculation uses the advanced driver model, if data for 
the model is present. In that case, when you use the report_delay_calculation  command to 
report the cell arc, it displays the message "Advanced driver-modeling used".
You do not need to set the rc_driver_model_mode  variable to advanced  to enable the CCS 
driver model. The CCS model is used automatically if the CCS libraries exist. However, 
you can set the rc_driver_model_mode  variable to basic  to disable the advanced CCS 
driver model.
When the rc_driver_model_mode  variable is set to basic  and the rc_receiver_model_mode 
variable is set to advanced, the timing engine uses the advanced voltage-dependent 
capacitance models to derive an equivalent single capacitance model that depends only 
on the rise, fall, minimum, or maximum arc condition. These equivalent capacitance values 
are used in the analysis instead of the pin capacitance values from the library. For details, 
see the rc_receiver_model_mode  variable man page.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar rc_driver_model_mode 
command.

rc_receiver_model_mode
Specifies the receiver model type to use for RC delay calculation.
Data Types
string
Default advanced
Description
This variable specifies whether the timing engine uses a basic or advanced receiver model 
for RC delay calculation. The basic  model is a single capacitance model that depends only 
on the rise, fall, minimum, or maximum arc condition. The advanced  model is a voltage-
dependent capacitance model that also depends on input slew and output capacitance.
One advantage of the advanced model is improved accuracy for both delay and slew 
calculation. Another advantage is that it considers nonlinear effects such as the Miller 
effect. The advanced receiver model is part of the Synopsys Composite Current Source 
(CCS) model.
When this variable is set to advanced  (the default), RC delay calculation uses 
the advanced receiver model if data for that model is present and if the network 
driver uses the advanced driver model. In that case, a report generated by the 
report_delay_calculation  command for a network arc displays the message "Advanced 
receiver-modeling used".
You do not need to set the rc_receiver_model_mode  variable to advanced  to enable the 
CCS receiver model. The CCS model is used automatically if the CCS libraries exist. 
However, you can set the rc_receiver_model_mode  variable to basic  to disable the 
advanced CCS receiver model.
When the rc_receiver_model_mode  variable is set to advanced, and the network is not 
driven by the advanced driver model (such as when the rc_driver_model_mode  variable 
is set to basic or a lumped load is used), the timing engine uses the advanced voltage-
dependent capacitance models to derive an equivalent single capacitance model that 
depends only on the rise, fall, minimum, or maximum arc condition. These equivalent 
capacitance values are used in analysis instead of the pin capacitance values from the 
library. The report_delay_calculation  command used on a network arc does not show 
the "Advanced receiver-modeling used" message for these calculations because only an 
equivalent single capacitance is used.

Data Types

Default 1 in Design Compiler non-topographical mode, Design Compiler topographical

Variable is not supported in DC Explorer
Description
This variable specifies a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates the 
derating needed for the transition times in the Synopsys library to match the transition 
times between the characterization trip points. The default is 1.0, which means that the 
transition times in the Synopsys library are used without change.
The value this variable specifies is overridden by any library-specified slew-derating 
values, so it should not be necessary to set the variable. The value specified applies only 
to libraries that do not contain slew-derating specifications.
A slew-derating value of 1.0 should be used if the transition times specified in the library 
represent the exact transition times between the characterization trip points, which 
is usually the case. Use a slew-derating value of less than 1.0 for libraries where the 
transition times have been extrapolated to the rail voltages. For example, if the transition 
times are characterized as between 30 percent and 70 percent and then extrapolated to 
the rails, the slew-derating value is 0.4 = (70 - 30) / 100.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar

Fanouts for registers that exceed a certain limit can cause an adverse affect on the 
circuit performance. The fanout is by default controlled only by buffer insertion. Some 
FPGA architectures lack buffers in the routing architecture that might cause the fixed 
fanout limit to exceed and cause an error in the back-end tool. To address this problem, 
the register_duplicate  variable provides a method to duplicate registers in an optimized 
manner.

The following is an example of the use of register_duplicate:

Description
The report_default_significant_digits  variable sets the default number of significant digits 
for many reports. Allowed values are 0-13; the default is -1. A value of -1 indicates that a 
command-specific default precision value is used for reporting. Some report commands, 
such as report_timing  and report_cell, have a -significant_digits  option, which overrides 
the value of this variable.
Not all reports respond to this variable. Check the man pages for individual reports to

reset by setting the value of the variable to -1. This causes the command-specific default 
to be used as the precision for reporting if the -significant_digits  command option is not 
used.
For example, assume the command-specific default precision of the report_cell  command 
is 6. If the report_default_significant_digits  variable is set to 5 and the report_cell 
command is run thereafter, a precision of 5 is used in the report_cell  report. If the 
report_cell -significant_digits 3  command is run after the above variable setting, a 
precision of 3 is used for the report_cell  report. To view the report_cell  report with the 
command default precision of 6, reset the value of the report_default_significant_digits 
variable by setting it to -1.
If an invalid value is set (not in the range 0-13 and not -1), an error is issued and the 
previous valid value is restored. The following example illustrates the usage of the 
variable:

You do not need to specify resistance values directly to set_rtl_load. Instead, you can 
cause the resistance value to be calculated as a constant factor times capacitance by 
setting the rtl_load_resistance_factor  variable to the constant factor required. Then, you 
execute set_rtl_load  with only the -capacitance  option, and the command calculates the 
resistance from the specified capacitance using the constant factor.
For example, if you set the rtl_load_resistance  variable to 0.5, specify the rtl-load 
capacitance of a pin as 4, and do not specify the rtl-load resistance, set_rtl_load  calculates 
the rtl-load resistance to be 2. The factor is applied to each annotated pin of a net 
individually, not to the net's capacitance as a whole. Note that the default library units are 
used throughout.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar rtl_load_resistance_factor 
command.

You must review the Tcl file for your design intent and source the Tcl file during the next 
compile session after setting the sdc_runtime_analysis_enable  variable to false  to see 
improvements in the runtime of the tool.
You can get an estimate of runtime benefit after applying the SDC fixes in the same debug 
run (instead of sourcing the file during the next compile session). This feature is available 
in the Design Compiler NXT tool.
The Design Compiler NXT tool automatically applies the potential fixes (provided in the 
Tcl file) in the same debug run. There might be an impact on QoR when you enable 
automatic fixing of SDC issues in the Design Compiler NXT tool due to the change in SDC 
constraints during the same debug run.
Note: Do not keep the sdc_runtime_analysis_enable  variable always set to true. Use the 
variable only to debug runtime issues related to SDC constraints.
To avoid the Design Compiler NXT tool from automatically applying the fixes provided in 
the Tcl file for SDC issues, set the sdc_runtime_fixing_enable  variable to false. The default 
is true.

For more details about the different SDC constraints identified and the potential fixes 
applied by the tool, see the "Reporting Runtime Issues Related to SDC Constraints" 
section in the Design Compiler User Guide.
The Design Compiler NXT and Design Compiler Graphical tools by default generate 
a Tcl script (sdc_runtime_<timestamp>.log.tcl) with the information message and Tcl 
commands to disable the identified SDC constraints that cause runtime issues. For 
example, sdc_runtime_24_10_2019_02_11_20.log.
To specify a different log file name or a standard output file, use the 
sdc_runtime_analysis_log_file  variable.
The following variable creates a new log file name to redirect the output to the

sdc_write_unambiguous_names
Ensures that cell, net, pin, lib_cell, and lib_pin names that are written to the SDC file are 
not ambiguous.
Data Types
Boolean
Default true
Description
This variable ensures that cell, net, pin, lib_cell, and lib_pin names that are written to the 
SDC file are not ambiguous.
When the hierarchy has been partially flattened, embedded hierarchy separators can 
make names ambiguous. It is unclear which hierarchy separator characters are part of the 
name and which are real separators.
Beginning with SDC Version 1.2, hierarchical names can be made unambiguous using 
the set_hierarchy_separator  SDC command and/or the -hsc  option for the get_cells, 
get_lib_cells, get_lib_pins, get_nets, and get_pins  SDC object access commands. By 
default, the tools write an SDC file, using these features to create unambiguous names.
It is wise to write SDC files that contain names that are not ambiguous. However, if you 
are using a third-party application that does not fully support SDC 1.2 or later versions

Writes out PATHCONSTRAINT constructs with nonpositive (<= 0) constraint values. 
When true, write_constraints -format sdf  writes out PATHCONSTRAINT constructs with 
nonpositive (<= 0) constraint values. When false  (the default), paths with nonpositive 
constraints are written with a constraint value of 0.01.
Nonpositive constraints can occur when the arrival time at a path startpoint is larger 
than the required arrival time at the path endpoint. This typically indicates an error, but is 
sometimes valid when generating constraints for a subdesign.

Description
Specifies the time scale of the delays written to timing files in SDF format. Delays from 
Design Compiler are written to timing files with write_timing. The sdfout_time_scale 
variable must be set if the library has no time unit specified and if the time unit of the 
delays in the library is different than 1 nanosecond. By default, the time unit is nanosecond 
and the time scale is 1. The only valid values for the SDF format are 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 
1, 10 and 100. The time unit is specified in the library with the attributes time_scale  and 
time_unit_name.
For example, a library with timing values in 10 picoseconds is specified with the attributes:
time_scale = 10 and time_unit_name = ps
When the attribute time_scale  is missing in the library, use the sdfout_time_scale  variable

Data Types
Boolean
Default true
Description
It is recommended to use the -continue_on_error  option to the source  command instead 
of this variable because that option only applies to a single script, and not the entire 
application session.
When set to true, the sh_continue_on_error  variable allows processing to continue when 
errors occur. Under normal circumstances, when executing a script with the source 
command, Tcl errors (syntax and semantic) cause the execution of the script to terminate.
When sh_continue_on_error  is set to false, script execution can also terminate due to new 
error and warning messages based on the value of the sh_script_stop_severity  variable.
To determine the current value of the sh_continue_on_error  variable, use the get_app_var 
sh_continue_on_error  command.

Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
The sh_new_variable_message  variable controls a debugging feature for tracing the 
creation of new variables. Its primary debugging purpose is to catch the misspelling of an 
application-owned global variable. When set to true, an informational message (CMD-041)

Other variables, in combination with sh_new_variable_message, enable tracing of new 
variables in scripts and Tcl procedures.
Warning: This feature has a significant negative impact on CPU performance when used 
with scripts and Tcl procedures. This feature should be used only when developing scripts

Note that the sh_new_variable_message  variable must be set to true  for this variable to 
have any effect. Both variables must be set to true  for the feature to be enabled. Enabling 
the feature simply enables the print_proc_new_vars  command. In order to trace the 
creation of variables in a procedure, this command must be inserted into the procedure, 
typically as the last statement. When all of these steps have been taken, an informational 
message (CMD-041) is generated for new variables defined within the procedure, up to 
the point that the print_proc_new_vars  commands is executed.

The sh_new_variable_message_in_script  variable controls a debugging feature for tracing

catch the misspelling of an application-owned global variable.
Note that this debugging feature is superseded by the new set_app_var  command. This 
command allows setting only application-owned variables. See the set_app_var  command 
man page for details.
Note that the sh_new_variable_message  variable must be set to true  for this variable to 
have any effect. Both variables must be set to true  for the feature to be enabled. In that 
case, an informational message (CMD-041) is displayed when a variable is defined for 
the first time. When sh_new_variable_message_in_script  is set to false  (the default), no 
message is displayed at the time that the variable is created. When the source  command 
completes, however, you see messages for any new variables that were created in the 
script. This is because the state of the variables is sampled before and after the source 
command. It is not because of inter-command sampling within the script. So, this is 
actually a more efficient method to see if new variables were created in the script.
For example, given the following script a.tcl:
echo "Entering script"
set a 23
echo a = $a
set b 24
echo b = $b
echo "Exiting script"
When sh_new_variable_message_in_script  is false  (the default), you see the following

is ignored and the old value is restored.
If the variable is later set to an non-empty string that is an valid filename, all subsequent 
logged output is written to this file. Any previous contents of the file are overwritten.
The log file may not capture the banner text from the beginning of the session, and does 
not capture the stack trace that is printed following a fatal error. You can use the UNIX tee

the name of the script and the line number of the command.
• When set to W, the generation of one or more warning or error messages causes a the 
CMD-082 message.
The setting of sh_script_stop_severity  affects the output of the CMD-082 message. If the 
setting of sh_script_stop_severity  causes a CMD-081 message, then it takes precedence 
over CMD-082.

Setting this variable to true  adjusts optimization inside the tool to prioritize formal

verification to pass with as little effort as possible. The variable is set to false  by default.
This variable affects the optimization done during the reading and elaboration of RTL files 
and when the insert_clock_gating  and compile_ultra  commands are run.
When you set this variable to true, the compile_ultra  command runs with the 
-no_autoungroup  option enabled. However, the -retime  option of the compile_ultra 
command is ignored, and the -global  option of the insert_clock_gating  and 
replace_clock_gates  commands is ignored.
The tool sets the value for the following environment variables when the 
simplified_verification_mode  variable is set to true  regardless of the value you specify:
compile_ultra_ungroup_dw = false,
      compile_clock_gating_through_hierarchy = false
      hdlin_verification_priority = true
The value for these variables is restored to the user-specified value when you set the 
simplified_verification_mode  variable to false. If you do not specify the value for these 
variables, the tool uses the default value.
When you run the compile_ultra  command, the simplified_verification_mode  variable 
adjusts the optimizations on datapath logic. It also identifies CRC logic in the design and 
isolates it by creating a new hierarchy.
When you set the simplified_verification_mode  variable to true, designs with the 
optimize_registers  attribute and DW_div_pipe components are not retimed because they 
can adversely affect verification success. However, optimizing these designs without 
retiming them can have a large impact on QoR and runtime. To enable the retiming of 
these designs, set the simplified_verification_mode_allow_retiming  variable to true  when 
you enable the simplified_verification_mode  variable.

not vary between runs if the same number of cores is specified using the set_host_options 
command. Results will differ between runs which use different numbers of cores (so for 
example, two identical runs using 4 cores will produce the same result as each other, and 
two identical runs using 8 cores will match, but the 4 core runs will differ from the 8 core 
runs.)
When set to false, Zroute global routing will use a single core for routing during compile.
This variable does not affect the behavior of global routing performed as part of the

Description
When enabling the variable, Design Compiler Graphical placer to be more aware of logic 
modules and naturally clumped groups of logic in your netlist. In general, the resulting 
placement will have improved quality with respect to these structures. The placement 
of modules and logic clumps will be more predictable from run to run. Small changes in 
your netlist or your constraints will not perturb where modules are placed. Logic modules 
are more likely to be properly placed near fixed connections such as ports and macros. 
Logic modules and logic clumps will generally be more self-cohesive. That is, a module 
is more likely to be placed in one physical area instead of more than one. Note that some 
logic modules may be composed of several loosely connected clumps. These loosely 
connected modules will still be divided if it helps QOR.

implementation selection on the synthetic component.
The list defined by this variable contains valid cell names in the current design. A simple 
wildcard pattern can be supported by using the get_cells  command.
Hierarchical cell names are not supported. For example, to force hierarchical incremental 
implementation selection on cell U0/U1/MULT, do not place U0/U1/MULT in the 
synlib_hiis_force_on_cells  list; put MULT in the list.
The compiler performs forced hierarchical incremental implementation selection only 
on instantiated DesignWare components that have a single implementation. If you 
add to the synlib_hiis_force_on_cells  list the cell name of an operator cell that is 
inferred in the design, the compiler does not perform forced hierarchical incremental 
implementation selection on the inferred cell. If there are multiple implementations 
available for a hierarchical DesignWare component, the compiler does not perform 
hierarchical incremental implementation selection on the DesignWare cell. To establish 
single implementation on such a cell, use the set_implementation  command on the cell or 
use the set_dont_use  command on all but one implementation.

The following example places all cell names that begin with the letter a  in the 
synlib_hiis_force_on_cells  list:

Data Types
list
Default ""
Description
Specifies a list of metastability-hardened multiple flip-flop cells (chains) that Design 
Compiler uses when mapping the flip-flop chains in DesignWare Library CDC components, 
such as DW_sync.
For Design Compiler to consider the flip-flop chain cells during mapping, the technology 
library cells should meet the following requirements:
1. The technology library should contain the single-bit version of the flip-flop that is used 
in the flip-flop chain. A special string flag, "ff_chains", should exist on the single flip-flop 
for Design Compiler to find the chained library cells in the technology library.
2. The technology library cells that contain flip-flop chains should contain the same type of 
flip-flop. That is, all the flip-flops in the flip-flop chain should be the same.
3. The flip-flop chains in the technology library should have special integer flags, 
"ff_chain_stage", to indicate how many flip-flops are contained in the flip-flop chain cell.
The technology library vendor that creates the flip-flop chain library cell can define these 
required attributes in the library source code as "user_defined" attributes.

The flip-flop chain library cell can contain any number of single flip-flops. Design Compiler 
maps the flip-flop chains in DesignWare Library CDC components to the appropriate and 
preferred flip-flop chain library cells.
For example, if an instance of a DesignWare Library CDC component is configured to use 
four levels of synchronization and the preferred flip-flop chain library cells have 2, 3, and 4 
flip-flops, the priority order is (from high to low):
One 4-flip-flop chain
Two 2-flip-flop chains
Four single flip-flops
Note that there are fewer requirements for single flip-flop metastability-hardened cells to 
be mapped as specified by the synlib_preferred_ffs  variable.

Description
Specifies a list of single flip-flop (FF), metastability-hardened library cells that DC will 
use when technology mapping synchronizer FF chains in DesignWare Library CDC 
components (for example DW_sync).
If there are technology FF library cells that are designed specifically for synchronizers 
(sometimes referred to as "metastability-hardened" cells), you can set them as the 
preferred sychronizer FF by adding them to the synlib_preferred_ffs list. When DC maps 
the synchronizer FF chains within DesignWare Library CDC components, it tries to map 
them to the preferred FF(s).
Note: After mapping, DC can still size the FF cell. So it is still possible for the FF 
synchronizer chain used within DesignWare Library CDC components to be mapped to a 
non-preferred FF library cell.

This variable specifies a list of synthetic libraries to use when compiling.
The synthetic_library  variable works much like the target_library  variable does for 
technology libraries. This variable can be set to be a list of zero or more sldb files that you 
want to use in the compile  or replace_synthetic  commands. When synthetic operators or 
modules are processed in compile, the operators, bindings, modules, and implementations 
of the specified library or libraries are used. Synthetic libraries are processed in order. 
So, if two modules in different libraries have the same name, the module in the first listed 
library is used.
As with target technology libraries, it is sometimes necessary to include your synthetic 
library as part of the link_library set. This is especially important when you instantiate 
synthetic modules.
Because HDL files automatically insert synthetic operators in a netlist, it is important 
to have a synthetic library defined that supports these operators. For this reason, the 
standard Synopsys library standard.sldb  is automatically inserted as the first entry in the

name, parameter names, and parameter values.
The template_naming_style  variable determines what character or characters appear 
between the design name and the parameter name. The string value must contain %s, 
which represents the name of the original design, and %p, which represents the name and 
value of the parameter or parameters. You can optionally include any ASCII character or 
characters, or none, between %s and %p. For example, for a design named DesignName 
that has a parameter parm1, the default %s_%p causes the name DesignName_parm1  to 
be generated.
Further, %s$%p, %s_*_%p, and %s%p would generate respectively the names 
DesignName$parm1, DesignName_*_parm1, and DesignNameparm1.

Description
When you are using a user-defined on-chip clocking (OCC) controller, this variable 
specifies the number of ATE clock synchronization cycles used by the OCC controller 
when a scan-enable transition initiates a transition between the ATE and OCC clocks.
This variable affects the content of the protocol file written at the end of the insert_dft 
command.
By default, this variable is set to 1, which models an OCC controller that waits for a single 
clock cycle after a scan-enable transition. When scan-enable is reasserted after capture, 
scan data is delayed by one cycle, and the load_unload procedure is created as follows:
load_unload {
  V { SE=1; ATE_CLK=P; _si-=X; _so=X}

You should change the value of this variable if your OCC controller does not need a 
synchronization cycle or if it requires more than one synchronization cycle after a scan-
enable transition.
For more information on the synchronization logic structures and timing relationships, see 
SolvNet article 035708, "What Does the test_ate_sync_cycles Variable Do?".
Normally, this variable only affects the test protocol. If the variable is not set to the proper 
value, the test protocol can be edited or regenerated. However, in serialized compressed 
scan flows, it also affects the architecture of the serializer clock controller. In these flows, 
if the variable is not set to the proper value, the serializer logic must be reinserted with the 
variable set to the correct value.

test_bsd_dead_cycle_after_update_dr
Adds dead cycles before EXTEST measurement cycle so that slow output pads can be 
measured.
Data Types
integer
Default 0 in Design Compiler non-topographical mode, Design Compiler topographical 
mode, Design Compiler NXT non-topographical mode, and Design Compiler NXT 
topographical mode
Variable is not supported in DC Explorer
Description
For designs with slow I/O pads or fast TCK clock frequencies or both, when the EXTEST 
instruction is active, the output pads might not settle before the value is measured in the 
clock cycle after the Update-DR state. In this case, you can add one or more dead cycles 
after the Update-DR state when the EXTEST instruction is active, which provide additional 
settling time for slow output pads.
You can use this variable to set the desired number of dead cycles. For example,
prompt> set_app_var test_bsd_dead_cycle_after_update_dr cycle_count
When the create_bsd_patterns  command is run, it creates patterns with the specified 
number of dead cycles before output measurement. TCK will not pulse during these dead 
cycles. The default is zero, which does not insert any dead cycles.

Variable is not supported in DC Explorer
Description
This variable defines the default switching time of bidirectional ports in a tester cycle. The 
value is a positive real number in nanoseconds. This value is used when a test protocol is 
generated for ATPG.
For ATPG, test_bsd_default_bidir_delay  defines the following for the design under test:
• The default time at which values are applied (driven) to the bidirectional ports in input 
mode during the parallel measure cycle.
• The time at which bidirectional ports are released (undriven) during the capture cycle.
• This variable affects only BSD applications.
The value of test_bsd_default_bidir_delay  must be less than the output strobe time and 
greater than the capture clock active edge value.
The value of this variable affects the outcome of the check_bsd  command and the test 
program produced by the create_bsd_patterns  or write_test  commands. The check_bsd 
command uses the value of this variable to check a design against the design rules of a 
bsd methodology.
Changing the value of test_bsd_default_bidir_delay  modifies the content of the inferred 
or created test protocol generated by check_bsd. To generate the test program, 
create_bsd_patterns  or write_test  uses the value of test_bsd_default_bidir_delay  in the 
test protocol attached to the vector database (.vdb) file.

Variable is not supported in DC Explorer
Description
This variable specifies whether BSD insertion gates the TCK clock connection of a user-
defined test data register (UTDR) with its instruction enable signal.
When this variable is set to false, which is the default, BSD insertion hooks the UTDR 
clock pin directly up to TCK. Any existing connections are discarded. No gating logic is 
inserted to suppress TCK when the instruction is inactive.
When this variable is set to true, BSD insertion gates the TCK signal with a MUX, with 
the select pin driven by the instruction enable signal. The MUX selects TCK when the 
instruction is active, and it selects the existing connection when the instruction is inactive.
Examples
Consider the following UTDR definition:
set_dft_signal -view spec -type tdi \\
  -hookup_pin BIST/WRAPPER_0/debug_in
set_dft_signal -view spec -type tdo \\
  -hookup_pin BIST/WRAPPER_0/debug_out

When this variable is set to false, which is the default, BSD insertion hooks the UTDR 
clock pin BIST/WRAPPER_0/clk directly to TCK, and the existing connection is lost.
When this variable is set to true, BSD insertion MUXes the existing signal at the UTDR

integer

Description
This variable identifies instruction register (IR) bits to be masked during the search by 
the check_bsd  command for all possible implemented instructions. By default, no bits are 
masked.
Masking IR bits shortens the sequential search. The sequential search becomes 
exponentially costly as the IR length increases beyond 8 bits. The compliance checker 
masks bits that contain a 1 in the binary equivalent of the decimal integer in this variable. 
For example, if you want to mask bits 0 and 3, set the variable with decimal 9, the 
equivalent of binary 00...1001. Similarly, a value of 7 (binary 00...0111) masks bits 0, 1 and 
2; 8 masks bit 3; and so on.

The compliance checker forces a 0 or a 1 into each masked bit, based on the binary 
equivalent of the decimal integer value of test_cc_ir_value_of_masked_bits, adjusted for 
the bit-width of the IR. For example, for a 4-bit IR, if bits 0 and 3 are masked and the value 
of test_cc_ir_value_of_masked_bits  is 5 (binary 0101), bit 0 receives a value of 1 and bit 3 
a value of 0.

test_core_wrap_sync_ctl_segment_length
Specifies the maximum length of CTL-modeled synchronizer register that can be included

Data Types
integer
Default 0
Description
This variable specifies the maximum segment length of synchronizer register that can be 
included in wrapper chains as shared wrapper cells in the maximized reuse core wrapping 
flow. If a synchronizer register longer than this is associated with a port, that port gets a 
dedicated wrapper cell.
A synchronizer register is a library cell register that has a CTL model with a single scan 
chain from scan data input to scan data output. Note that a multibit register is something 
different, and is not affected by this variable.
The default is 0, which indicates that no CTL-modeled register (including single-bit 
registers) can be included in wrapper chains. Note that in this default case, when tool finds 
any CTL-modeled cell associated with a design port, a dedicated wrapper cell is added to 
the port.
By default, synchronizer registers always count as 1 in the fanout threshold computation, 
regardless of internal synchronizer length. To make them count according to their segment 
length, set the test_core_wrap_use_sync_ctl_segment_length_for_fanout_check  variable 
to true.
If a CTL-modeled cell other than a synchronizer register is associated with a port, that port 
always gets a dedicated wrapper cell.
This variable is used only in maximized reuse core wrapper flows.
This variable does not apply to synchronizer registers modeled using Liberty library 
constructs.

Description
This variable specifies how the maximized reuse fanout computation should treat the

different, and is not affected by this variable.)
When set to false  (the default), synchronizer registers always count for 1 in the threshold 
computation, regardless of their segment length. This reflects fanin/fanout count for a port.
When set to true, synchronizer registers count as their segment length in the threshold

This variable affects only designs that have DFTMAX Ultra compression modes.
When this variable is set to false  (the default), external clock chains are not included in the 
-chain_count  specification of the set_scan_configuration  command, which means that the 
actual number of chains architected (including clock chains) is larger than the chain count 
specification.
This behavior is different than other test modes (compressed and uncompressed), and it 
is different than the behavior of non-OCC external chains, which can lead to confusion. 
Although the behavior only occurs when DFTMAX Ultra compression is used, it is applied 
to other test modes as a result.
When this variable is set to true, the chain count is included in the -chain_count 
specification of the set_scan_configuration  command. This behavior is consistent with 
other test modes and with the behavior of non-OCC external chains.

By default, when the tool inserts an on-chip clocking (OCC) controller and its clock chain, 
the clock chain clock connection shares the first functional clock output of the OCC 
controller. This places the clock chain in both the PLL and ATE clock paths.
To use a dedicated clock-chain clock connection from the OCC controller design, set this 
variable to true. This creates a dedicated OCC controller clock output for the clock chain 
that places it in only the ATE clock path, which prevents it from affecting the high-speed 
PLL clock path.
In both cases, you should consider how the clock-chain connection interacts with clock 
tree synthesis (CTS). Depending on the value of this variable and the CTS configuration 
used for the PLL/ATE clocks, the clock chain might or might not be included in a 
synthesized clock clock tree. If you are performing CTS at the functional OCC controller 
output but you are using a dedicated clock chain clock connection, consider hold time 
effects within the clock chain (if no CTS is performed for the ATE clock domain) and 
shifting to/from the clock chain (if the clock latency to the clock chain differs from that of 
the functional clock domain).
This variable can be set to true  only when the test_occ_insert_clock_gating_cells  variable 
is also set to true.

Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
This variable instructs the tool to always create dedicated scan-out ports on subdesigns. 
By default, the tool uses existing subdesign output ports where possible. When this 
variable is set to true, the tool creates new dedicated output ports for scan.
This variable only affects cases where the Q output of flop is directly connected to output 
of a subblock. If the variable is set to true, the tool creates a new, separate output port 
driven by the register. As a result, the register output net becomes a multiport net and 
buffers must be added to fix the multiport condition.
If the variable is set to false  (the default), the functional output port driven by the register 
gets reused as a scan-out.
If there is no register that directly drives an output port, the tool does not reuse a functional 
port via a MUX; instead, it creates a new scan-out port.

and ScanCompression_mode modes for each partition. Each scan-in and scan-out port 
connects to a single partition CODEC. There must be a sufficient number of scan-in and 
scan-out ports available to satisfy all partition CODEC connections.
When you set this variable to true, the scan chain counts are summed across the 
Internal_scan and ScanCompression_mode modes to build a more adaptive CODEC that 
is shared by all partitions. However, instead of building one large CODEC that connects 
to all partitions, this common CODEC is replicated for each partition. Functionally, all 
partitions share the same CODEC. Architecturally, this common CODEC is duplicated to 
keep routing local within the partition and to minimize top-level congestion.
For each duplicated CODEC, a separate subset of the decompressor outputs 
and compressor inputs are hooked up to each partition according to the 
ScanCompression_mode scan chain count for that partition. The scan-in ports are shared, 
so that each scan-in port drives all CODECs. The scan-out ports are combined using 
XOR logic so that the top-level scan-out ports can capture the output from all partition 
compressors scan outputs. This architecture has similar testability efficiency to having a 
single top-level CODEC with the same architecture.
With the shared CODEC architecture, each partition's CODEC has only its subset of 
compressor and decompressor signals connected. After running insert_dft, you should 
perform an incremental compile with boundary scan optimization enabled to optimize the 
CODEC logic to each partition.

By default, DFT Compiler performs basic analysis of clock network logic to determine 
clock propagation behavior. However, for complex clock network logic, you can enable 
advanced clock feedthrough analysis by setting the following variable:
prompt> set_app_var test_fast_feedthrough_analysis true
This variable setting uses the TetraMAX DRC engine (which the dft_drc  command runs 
internally) to detect clock feedthrough paths in the logic of the current design.
Enabling fast feedthrough analysis can help during both core creation and core integration:
• During core creation, feedthroughs from input port through complex logic to output port 
can be detected and included in the CTL model of the core.
• During core integration, if you have CTL-modeled cores that contain unidentified 
feedthrough paths, you can also set the test_simulation_library  variable to configure 
the TetraMAX DRC engine to use a netlist simulation model for that core.
If you created the core with advanced feedthrough analysis, the CTL model should 
include any feedthrough paths through complex logic and you should not need to 
reanalyze the logic using a netlist simulation model. However, verify that the CTL 
model includes all expected feedthrough paths in this case.
Note that although feedthroughs that vary on a per-test-mode basis can be understood 
by DFT DRC and insertion of the current design, they cannot be described in the resulting 
CTL model.

scan-enable target pins.
When this variable is set to the default value of false, if a scan-enable target pin already

enable pin. During DFT insertion, the insert_dft  command issues a TEST-394 warning to 
note the disconnection:
Warning: Disconnecting pin 'UMEMWRAP/UMEM/SE' to route scan enable. 
 (TEST-394)
When this variable is set to true, if a target scan-enable pin already has a connection 
(besides a test-ready deasserted constant value), DFT Compiler skips that target pin. In 
this case, the insert_dft  command issues a TEST-410 warning to confirm that the existing 
connection is kept:
Warning: Not disconnecting pin 'UMEMWRAP/UMEM/SE' to route scan enable. 
 (TEST-410)
If you need to make a scan-enable connection somewhere else in the existing logic driving 
the target pin, you can use the set_dft_connect  command to add additional scan-enable 
target pins for DFT insertion:
set_dft_signal \\
  -type ScanEnable -usage scan \\
  -view spec \\
  -port SCAN_EN -connect_to UMEMWRAP/SCAN_EN
During DFT insertion, DFT Compiler may replace existing scan cells. To prevent this 
behavior the scan-enable target pins of the scan cell must be functionally connected. Set 
this variable to true  to keep this connection and avoid replacing the scan cell.

Data Types
string
Default test_mode%s
Description
This variable determines the naming style to be used by the insert_dft  command for test 
mode ports created in designs during the addition of test point circuitry. New ports are not 
created if suitable ports are identified with the set_dft_signal  command.
This variable must contain one %s (percent s) character sequence. When a port is added, 
if its name is the same as that of an existing port, %s is replaced by a character (a  through 
z) that creates a unique name.
For example, if this variable is set to MY_TM%s, when synthesis adds a new port for the 
test mode signal, the port is named
MY_TM
If a port named MY_TM  already exists in the design, the new port is named
MY_TMa

test_mux_constant_si
Specifies how scan insertion uses a port you declare as scan input, when the port is tied 
high or to the ground in functional mode.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
This variable specifies how scan insertion uses a port you declare as scan input, when the 
port is tied high or to the ground in functional mode.
When this variable is set to false  (the default value), scan insertion ignores the tie-off logic 
and directly uses the port as a scan input. This might change the output of the design 
during functional mode.
When this variable is set to true, scan insertion multiplexes the scan input signal with the 
constant logic, using the scan enable signal to control the multiplexer.

test_mux_constant_so

Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
This variable specifies how scan insertion uses a port you declare as a scan output, when 
the port has an existing connection to logic zero or logic one before scan insertion.
When this variable is set to false, which is default, if the specified port is tied to logic zero 
or logic one, DFT Compiler ignores the constant value during scan insertion and drives the 
port directly as a scan output. This behavior ensures that no additional logic is added at 
the port if it was undriven in the RTL and tied to logic zero during synthesis.

If the existing constant value driving the port is required for proper operation in functional 
mode, set this variable to true. In this case, DFT Compiler multiplexes the scan-out signal 
with the constant value, using the scan-enable signal to control the multiplexer, so that the 
functional behavior remains unchanged.
This variable affects only scan output ports that are explicitly defined using the 
set_dft_signal -type ScanDataOut  command.

Description
This variable specifies the style the insert_dft  command uses to name the ports that clock 
gating creates for nonscan clocks.
This variable must contain one %s (percent s) character sequence. The %s is replaced by 
a string identifying the original clock, its inversion (either i  for inverted or n  for noninverted), 
and the inactive level (either 0 or 1).
The following example shows the renaming of this variable from its setting of MY_NSC_
%s to MY_NSC_clockn0. When insert_dft  creates a nonscan clock (from an original clock 
named "clock") that is noninverted and inactive low, that port is named

This variable specifies whether codecs inserted by DFTMAX use a consistent load-mode 
architecture, which can be helpful in the shared codec I/O flow.
When the shared codec I/O feature is enabled with the -shared_inputs  option of the 
set_scan_compression_configuration  command, the tool shares three categories of input 
pins across all codecs: load-mode, high X-tolerance, and scan pins. Pins are shared 
across codecs within each category, but not across the categories.
The high X-tolerance and scan pin counts are predictable, but the load-mode pin count 
can sometimes vary across codecs, which can make it difficult to know what sharing 
configuration to use.
You can set this variable to true  to force newly inserted codecs in the current design to use 
two load-mode pins. This prevents load-mode pin count variability.
If you leave this variable set to its default of false, load-mode pins are still shared, even if 
their counts differ across codecs.
For more information on shared codec I/O pin categories, see the user guide 
documentation on determining the fully shared I/O configuration.

If a simulation model is provided for a cell which already has functional information in the

complete simulation models to be provided for complex cells which have simplified or 
dummy functionality in the technology library.
The Verilog functional descriptions for the cells specified with the test_simulation_library 
variable must be self-contained. They cannot depend on any functionality of cells defined 
in the $link_library, since dft_drc  does not convert the entire $link_library; it only converts 
the cells instantiated by the current design.
Examples
The following example shows how you can set the simulation library to files containing 
multiple models each:
lappend search_path ./my_lib_models
set test_simulation_library {all_my_memories.v all_my_reg_files.v}
In the above example, the memory and register file model files are located using the 
search path, and read in to comprise the simulation library.
The test_simulation_library  variable also accepts the asterisk (*) wildcard character in the 
file names to allow for the case where multiple files under a certain directory comprise the 
simulation library files:
set test_simulation_library {/root/install/xyz/lib/verilog/*.v}
In this example, all files with a ".v" name extension under the /root/install/xyz/lib/verilog/ 
directory are considered to comprise the simulation library. The asterisk (*) is the only 
wildcard character allowed in the library file name. If a wildcard is used in the file name, 
specify the full path name of the library files. This avoids the combined effect of the 
search_path and the wildcard character bringing in unexpected files as the simulation 
library.

Description
This variable specifies whether multibit registers can be shared wrapper cells in wrapper 
chains.
When set to true  (the default), multibit cells can be used in wrapper chains. For best 
results, configure core wrapping before performing multibit banking with
• The initial compile_ultra  command (RTL inference flow)
• The identify_register_banks  command (physical banking flow)
This ensures that multibit cells anticipate the I/O register classification requirements of 
core wrapping.
When set to false, multibit cells cannot be used in wrapper chains. Note that in this case, 
core wrapping does not place any restrictions on multibit banking of I/O registers. If any 
port is associated with a multibit cell, a TEST-1067 warning message is issued and the 
port gets a dedicated wrapper cell. If you see this message, you can improve your QoR by 
restoring this variable to its default of true.
This variable is used only when the maximized reuse wrapper flow is enabled. Multibit 
cells cannot be shared wrapper cells in the simple wrapper flow.
test_soc_wrp_soft_core_non_abutted_flow
Allows user to enable non abutted wrapping.
Data Types

Description
This variable allows user to enable non-abutted flow in partition aware soft core testcase. 
Non-abutted flow allows wrapper analysis of top level along with soft cores. In order to

The variable has an effect only when used in conjunction with the 
set_scan_suppress_toggling  command, which configures the insertion of toggle 
suppression logic that prevents unnecessary functional logic toggling during scan shift.
When toggling suppression is enabled, and the variable is set to a string value "myprefix", 
toggle suppression gates added by the insert_dft  command will be named in the form:
<myprefix>_<register_cell_leaf_name>_<gated_output_pin_name>
For example, if you set the variable to QGATE, a gating cell inserted at CORE/ENAB_reg/
Q would be named CORE/QGATE_ENAB_reg_Q. Since the gating cell is placed at the 
same level of hierarchy as the gated scan cell, they both share the same hierarchical path 
name.
When this variable is set to an empty string, which is the default, the gating cell instance 
names are determined by the compile_instance_name_prefix  variable.
To determine the current value of this variable, use the printvar 
test_suppress_toggling_instance_name_prefix  command. For a list of compile variables

test_sync_occ_1x_period
Specifies the clock period for the slowest-frequency PLL clock of a DFT-inserted

Data Types
positive nonzero integer

Description
When you insert a synchronous OCC controller, you can optionally specify the clock period 
of the slowest-frequency clock with this variable. It affects the clock period values in the 
ClockTiming block of the STIL protocol file created by the tool. Although the value does not 
affect pattern generation in TetraMAX, you can specify it for informational purposes.
This value is used for all synchronous OCC controllers in the design.
This variable must be set so that any 2X or 4X clocks have an integer period value greater 
than 1 when derived (by division) from this 1X clock period value. If you control any 2X 
frequency clocks, this value should be at least 4 and be divisible by 2. If you control any 
4X frequency clocks, this value should be at least 8 and be divisible by 4.

test_tp_enable_logic_type
Specifies what type of enable logic to implement for test point registers.
Data Types
Boolean
Default gate
Description
This variable controls what type of enable logic to implement for test point registers.
When a test point's control signal is deasserted, its test point registers is held at a known 
static value. This variable controls how that logic is implemented.
The valid values for this variable are:
• gate  - AND/OR gate at the register Q pin
The register output is ANDed or ORed with the control signal. When the control signal 
is deasserted, the register output is also deasserted.
• reset  - asynchronous-reset register
The register is reset to logic zero whenever the control signal is deasserted. (However, 
the reset is blocked when the scan-enable signal is asserted, to allow for scan 
operation in test modes where the test point is not active.)
• set  - asynchronous-set register
This is the same as the reset  case, except that an asynchronous set is implemented 
instead.
The logic implementation considers whether the control signal is active-high or active-
low, and the type of enable logic specified by this variable, so that deasserting the control 
signal deactivates the test points.
This variable applies to both automatically inserted and user-defined test point registers. It 
requires that the testability  DFT client be enabled with the set_dft_configuration  command.

Default false
Description
This variable, when set to true, instructs the dft_drc  command to check the connectivity of 
test mode and constant pins of design instances that are represented by CTL models.
When this feature is enabled, the dft_drc  command simulates the test_setup procedure of 
the all_dft mode of the CTL mode associated with the current design, and then inspects 
the logical value at the test mode and constant pins of all instantiated designs that are 
represented by CTL models. The feature then reports any mismatch on a pin in term of 
actual value (propagated to the pin) versus the expected value (the one that is defined in 
the test_setup of the instantiated CTL model).
If any mismatch is found, all scan chains in the involved CTL model instance will not be 
considered in building scan chains in the current design.

Setting this variable to true allows tie-off optimization down to the lowest hierarchy without 
port punching to fix constant nets that cross multiple hierarchies.
For example, a violating constant net that drives an input port followed by multiple loads, 
the tool fixes the violation by inserting an optimized number of tie cells down to the lowest 
hierarchy to drive the loads and removing the original driving cell. You can choose to keep 
the original driving cell by setting the tieoff_hierarchy_opt_keep_driver  variable.

timing_clock_reconvergence_pessimism
Selects signal transition sense matching for computing clock reconvergence pessimism 
removal.
Data Types
string
Default normal
Description
This variable determines how the value of the clock reconvergence pessimism removal 
(CRPR) is computed with respect to transition sense. Allowed values are normal  (the 
default) and same_transition.
When set to normal, the CRPR value is computed even if the clock transitions to the 
source and destination latches are in different directions on the common clock path. It is 
computed separately for rise and fall transitions and the value with the smaller absolute 
value is used.
When set to same_transition, the CRPR value is computed only when the clock transition 
to the source and destination latches have a common path and the transition is in the 
same direction on each pin of the common path. Thus, if the source and destination 
latches are triggered by different edge types, CRPR is computed at the last common pin at 
which the launch and capture edges match.
If the variable is set to same_transition, the CRPR for all minimum pulse width checks will 
be zero, as they are calculated using different (rise and fall) clock edges.

Data Types
Boolean
Default true
Description
This variable controls the clock reconvergence pessimism removal (CRPR) in cases 
where two related clocks reconverge in the logic. Two clocks are related if one is a 
generated clock and the other is its parent, or both are generated clocks of the same 
parent clock. Although this variable name refers specifically to multiplexers, the variable 
applies to any situation where two related clocks reconverge within combinational logic.
By default, the separate clock paths up to the multiplexer are treated as reconvergent, 
and the CRP includes the reconvergence point as well as any downstream common 
logic. When this variable is set to false, the common pin is the last point where the clocks 
diverged to become related clocks.
If the design contains related clocks that switch dynamically, set this variable to false  so 
the CRP is not removed. Related clocks switch dynamically when a timing path launches 
from one related clock and the clock steering logic switches dynamically so the path 
captures on the other related clock.
The default value is true, which removes the additional CRP.

The variable has no effect if CRPR is not active; the 
timing_remove_clock_reconvergence_pessimism  variable is set to false). The larger 
the value of timing_crpr_threshold_ps, the faster the runtime when CRPR is active. The 
recommended setting is about half stage (gate plus net) delay of a typical gate in the clock 
network. It provides a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and runtime in most cases.
You might want to use different settings throughout the design cycle: larger during the 
design phase, smaller for sign-off. You might want to experiment and set a different value 
when moving to a different technology.

least one conditional arc. By default, these nonconditional timing arcs are not disabled. 
This variable is primarily intended to deal with the situation between two pins that have 
conditional arcs, where there is always a default timing arc with no condition.
Set this variable to true  when the specified conditions cover all possible state-dependent 
delays, so that the default arc is useless. For example, consider a 2-input XOR gate with

Description
This variable, when set to false, enables the acceptance of recovery and removal arcs 
specified in the technology library. Recovery or removal timing arcs impose constraints 
on asynchronous pins of sequential cells. Typically, recovery time specifies the time the 
inactive edge of the asynchronous signal has to arrive before the closing edge of the 
clock. Removal time specifies the length of time the active phase of the asynchronous 
signal must be held after the closing edge of clock.
To enable the compile, report_timing, and report_constraint  commands to accept recovery 
or removal arcs specified in the library, set timing_disable_recovery_removal_checks  to 
false.
Note that independent of the value of this variable, the write_timing  and

information.
This variable is the logical opposite of the variable enable_recovery_removal_arcs. If you

Compiler tool determines that time borrowing is occurring at such a D-pin, it creates a

Sometimes there is a difference between the launch and capture latch latencies, due 
either to reconvergent paths in the clock network or different min and max delays of cells 
in the clock network. For setup paths, the tool uses the late value to launch and the early 
value to capture. This achieves the tightest constraint and prevents optimism. However,

for paths starting from latch D-pins, this analysis is pessimistic because the data simply 
passes through and thus does not even "see" the clock edge at the latch.
When this timing variable is set to true  (the default), such pessimism is eliminated by using 
the early latch latency to launch the path. Note that only paths that originate from a latch 
D-pin are affected. When the variable is set to false, late clock latency is used to launch all 
setup paths in the design.
When the timing_early_launch_at_borrowing_latches  and 
timing_remove_clock_reconvergence_pessimism  variables are both set to true, it is not 
possible to apply both pessimism removal techniques on the same timing path. Therefore, 
the tool applies early launch pessimism removal to paths that start from a transparent latch 
D-pin and applies CRPR to the remaining paths.
For a design with long clock paths, it might be preferable to set the 
timing_early_launch_at_borrowing_latches  variable to false. Doing so allows CRPR to be 
applied to all paths, including those that start from a transparent latch D-pin. When clock 
paths are long, CRPR can be the more powerful pessimism reduction technique.
On the other hand, for a design with clock paths having long common 
segments, or where critical paths traverse several latches, leaving the 
timing_early_launch_at_borrowing_latches  variable set to true  might result in more 
pessimism removal overall, even though paths that start from a transparent D-pin do not 
get any CRPR credit.

This variable does not cause incremental derate settings across different object scopes 
(leaf cell/net, library cell, hierarchical cell, global) to be added together; such settings still 
follow the usual object scope precedence rules.

set_timing_derate -late -cell_delay -increment 0.01 [get_cells core/U123]
set_timing_derate -late -cell_delay -increment 0.01 [get_cells core/U123]
set_timing_derate -late -cell_delay -increment 0.04 [get_cells core]
set_timing_derate -late -cell_delay -increment 0.04 [get_cells core]
then the leaf cell incremental derate of 0.02 is used for core/U123. If the leaf cell 
incremental derate is subsequently removed:
reset_timing_derate -increment [get_cells core/U123]

timing_enable_multiple_clocks_per_reg
Enables analysis of multiple clocks that reach a single register.
Data Types
Boolean
Default true
Description
This variable enables analysis of multiple clocks that reach a register clock pin. When set 
to true  (the default), all clocks reaching the register are analyzed simultaneously, including 
interactions between different clocks, such as data launch by one clock and data capture 
by another. If there are four or more clocks per register and the design contains level-
sensitive registers, a high impact on runtime might occur.
If your design has a large number of different interacting clocks, you can set this 
variable to false  to eliminate consideration of all clock interactions and get results more 
quickly. However, to get fully accurate results, leave the variable set to true  and use 
the set_false_path  command to explicitly specify the actual false interactions between 
mutually exclusive clocks.

Description
When set to true, this variable enables normalized slack analysis during timing updates. 
When set to false  (the default), this variable disables normalized slack analysis and 
reporting.
Normalized slack analysis is an optional analysis method that calculates normalized slack 
for each timing path:
normalized_slack = path_slack / 
 idealized_allowed_propagation_delay_for_path
The tool computes the allowed propagation delay for the path using ideal clock edges; it 
ignores setup time, uncertainty, and clock latency. The allowed propagation delay can be a 
half-cycle, a full cycle, or multiple cycles. It can be more complicated to compute when the 
launch and capture clocks are different.
Normalized slack analysis can be used to determine the paths that limit the clock 
frequency. A normalized slack report prioritizes violating paths that are allowed few clock 
cycles. Fixing these paths first results in the most improvement in the clock period.
If normalized slack analysis is enabled during update timing, you can gather and 
report paths according to normalized slack by using the commands report_timing 
-normalized_slack  and get_timing_paths -normalized_slack.

By default, this variable is set to false, resulting in "greedy" time-borrowing behavior, 
in which latch time borrowing matches the D pin arrival time, producing zero slack at 
borrowing latches.
When this variable is set to true, during optimization, the tool sets the amount of time 
borrowing at transparent latches in a manner that distributes negative or positive slack 
evenly among the latches of a multistage latch path. The runtime and memory usage 
might be longer using this setting.
Slack distribution spreads all nonzero slack, negative or positive, across all multistage 
borrowing latch paths. By spreading positive path slacks, hold fixing and area QoR might 
be improved. This setting affects the behavior of the compile_ultra  command in the 
Synopsys Physical Guidance (SPG) mode.
Slack distribution, when enabled, overrides automatic time borrowing (controlled by the 
disable_auto_time_borrow  variable). Automatic time borrowing distributes only the worst 
negative slack across certain multistage latch paths.

timing_enable_through_paths
Enables or disables advanced analysis and reporting through transparent latches.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
When set to true, this variable enables advanced analysis through transparent latches 
during timing updates and reporting. When set to false  (the default), this variable disables 
advanced analysis and reporting through transparent latches.
By default timer analyzes and reports paths through transparent latches as a series of 
path segments between latches. These segments can be reported together using the 
report_timing  option -trace_latch_borrow. Max pin slacks (max_rise_slack, max_fall_slack) 
for a pin in the design can be affected by borrowing latches in the fanin of the pin, but are 
not affected by timing calculations in parts of the design past the first level of latches in the 
fanout of the pin.
With the advanced analysis through transparent latches, paths through latches can be 
reported as a single timing path. Pin slacks can be affected by timing calculations past

the first level of latches in the fanout. In addition, specific paths through latches can be 
requested using the -from, -through, and -to  options of report_timing, where the options 
specify objects that are separated by one or more transparent latches.
The advanced analysis is limited when there are latch loops in the design. The tool 
chooses specific latch data pins in the loops to act as loop breaker latches. For these 
latch data pins, the behavior is the same as if the variable timing_enable_through_paths 
was set to false. Reporting through these special latch data pins is not supported. The 
tool automatically selects which latch data pins to act as loop breaker latches. The user 
can guide the selection using the set_latch_loop_breaker  command. Because of the 
runtime associated with the advanced analysis, by default the tool also selects some latch 
data pins outside loops to have the same behavior as if timing_enable_through_paths 
was false. The variable timing_through_path_max_segments  can be used to control the 
selection of these pins.
To determine the current setting, use the following command:

timing_ignore_paths_within_block_abstraction
Causes timing paths entirely within a block abstraction to be ignored.
Data Types
Boolean

Description
The process of creating abstract blocks removes as much logic as possible from the 
internal portions of the block, while keeping cells and nets that are necessary to preserve 
paths that connect to the outside of the block. However, in a block abstraction, there can 
be residual paths entirely within the boundary logic that do not traverse outside the block.
Setting this variable to true  causes the timing on paths that remain entirely within the 
abstracted block to be ignored. The tool behaves as if there is an implied false path 
constraint on such paths, both for reporting and for optimization. A path that starts and 
ends inside and abstracted block, but exits from and returns to the block somewhere in the 
middle, is not affected by this variable.
When this variable is true, it allows transparent interface optimization to focus on paths 
that traverse outside the abstracted blocks.

Description
Normalized slack analysis is an optional analysis method that calculates normalized slack 
for each timing path:
normalized_slack = path_slack / 
 idealized_allowed_propagation_delay_for_path
The tool computes the allowed propagation delay for the path using ideal clock edges; it 
ignores setup time, uncertainty, and clock latency. The allowed propagation delay can be a 
half-cycle, a full cycle, or multiple cycles. It can be more complicated to compute when the 
launch and capture clocks are different.
The timing_max_normalization_cycles  variable limits the runtime and memory used in this 
analysis by placing an upper limit on the denominator of the fraction used to calculate the 
normalized slack. The maximum allowed value of this denominator is this variable setting 
multiplied by the period of the launch clock for the path.
Setting a larger value supports a larger range of allowed propagation delays, possibly at 
the cost of more runtime and memory usage.

Data Types
float
Default 3
Description
Parametric on-chip variation (POCV) analysis internally computes arrival times, required 
times, and slack values based on statistical distributions. When performing comparisons 
between these statistical quantities, the tool needs to know what values in the distribution 
are considered worst-case.
The default behavior is to choose values at 3.0 standard deviations away from the mean 
value. In other words, for an arrival time distribution, the worst-case early arrival is 3.0 
standard deviations below the mean, and the worst-case late arrival is 3.0 standard 
deviations above the mean.
You can use this variable set a different number of standard deviations away from the 
mean to determine the worst-case values for timing reports. Use a lower value such as 2.5 
for less worst-case variation and more relaxed timing constraints. Conversely, use a higher 
value such as 3.5 for more worst-case variation and more restrictive timing constraints.

Description
When this variable is set to true, the tool performs parametric on-chip variation (POCV) 
timing analysis. In this analysis mode, the tool internally computes arrival times, required 
times, and slack values as statistical distributions rather than fixed minimum and maximum 
values.
To determine the cumulative delay of a path, the POCV mode statistically combines the 
delay distribution of each stage. This is more accurate than simply adding the worst-case 
value from each stage. The resulting delay and slack values are more realistic and less 
pessimistic than values calculated by ordinary addition.
Before you can use POCV analysis, you must specify the statistical delay behavior of the 
logic gates used in the design and read that information into the tool using the read_ocvm 
command.
Note that POCV timing analysis uses more runtime than conventional timing analysis.

timing_remove_clock_reconvergence_pessimism
Enables or disables clock reconvergence pessimism removal.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
This variable, when set to true, instructs the synthesis timing engine to remove clock 
reconvergence pessimism from slack calculation and minimum pulse width checks.
Clock reconvergence pessimism (CRP) is a difference in delay along the common part 
of the launching and capturing clock paths. The most common causes of CRP are 
reconvergent paths in the clock network and different minimum and maximum delay of 
cells in the clock network.
Any effective change in the value of the timing_remove_clock_reconvergence_pessimism 
variable causes a full update_timing. You cannot perform one report_timing  operation that 
considers CRP and one that does not without a full update_timing  in between.

Default {dont_touch dont_use map_only size_only ideal_net infeasible_paths}
Description
This variable specifies the attributes reported by the report_timing -attributes  command. 
The list can contain any of the following attributes: dont_touch, dont_use, map_only, 
size_only, infeasible_paths  (Design Compiler and DC Explorer only), ideal_network, 
clock_marking, clock_marking, pass_gate, always_on, net_pattern, and ideal_net.
When you use the -attributes  option of the report_timing  command, the report shows the 
attributes that apply to each path increment under the heading "Attributes". A symbol 
key at the beginning of the path report lists the letter codes used for the attributes being 
reported. For example,
Attributes:

timing_report_fast_mode
Enables the fast report_timing  mode, which reports the worst timing paths among all path

Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
This variable, when set to true, selects the fast reporting mode for the report_timing  and 
get_timing_paths  commands.
When this variable is set to false (the default), the worst timing paths are reported 
separately for each path group. When this variable is set to true, the worst paths in the 
design are reported, irrespective of path groups, so fewer paths are reported.
Setting this variable to true results in the following changes in reporting behavior:
• The values specified with the -max_paths  and -nworst  options apply to all paths in the 
design rather than paths in each path group. For example, if the design has 12 path 
groups and -max_paths  is set to 3, only 3 paths are reported instead of 36.
• The paths reported by the command are ordered strictly by slack and are not separated 
by path group.
• When the -max_paths  and -nworst  options are set to values larger than 1, only paths 
with negative slack are reported; paths with positive slack are omitted from the report.
Setting this variable to true results in the same reporting behavior as PrimeTime with 
respect to path groups and the -max_paths  and -nworst  options.

timing_report_union_tns
Specifies whether to use the union method for reporting total negative slack and number of

Boolean
Default true
Description
When this variable is set to true  (the default), the tool counts a violating endpoint only once 
when computing the total negative slack (TNS) and the number of violating endpoints for 
a path group, scenario, or design. The TNS for a path group is the sum of worst violations 
for all endpoints in that path group. The TNS for a scenario is the sum of worst violations 
in that scenario for all endpoints, irrespective of the path group. The TNS for a design is 
the sum of worst violations for all endpoints, irrespective of path group or scenario.
When this variable is set to false, the tool computes the scenario TNS as the sum of TNS 
for all path groups in that scenario. The multi-scenario TNS is computed as the sum of 
TNS for all scenarios.

When timing_through_path_max_segments  is set to a non-zero value, the tool selects 
some latch data pins on paths with many transparent latches to behave as they would 
if timing_enable_through_paths  were false, limiting the reporting on the long path but 
speeding up analysis. With a small non-zero value, many transparent latch data pins in the 
design will be selected. With a larger value, fewer will be selected.
When timing_through_path_max_segments  is set to 0, no latch data pins are selected. 
Reporting on paths through many latches is allowed, but analysis may be slower.

Description
When this variable set to false  (the default), total capacitance (Ctot) values are compared 
against the maximum capacitance limit during DRC fixing. When this variable is set to true, 
effective capacitance (Ceff) values are used instead.
Total capacitance is the sum of all the capacitance values in an RC network. Effective 
capacitance is a lumped value that results in a similar delay effect as the full RC network, 
calculated as the average capacitive loading that a gate observes at the delay trip-point.
The effective capacitance can be very different from the maximum total capacitive loading 
experienced by the gate. Choosing to use effective capacitance can possibly result in 
extrapolation errors.
Setting the variable to true  may result in less pessimistic DRC fixing. Before you set 
this variable to true, be sure to carefully evaluate your capacitance fixing and signoff 
methodology.

for each type of transition. This setting is recommended for better timing correlation with 
the PrimeTime tool.
When this variable is set to false, the tool uses the single default capacitance value 
specified in the library description of the pin and ignores any enhanced capacitance 
information.
The library description of pin in Liberty format can contain both a default capacitance value 
and more specific values or ranges of capacitance values for rise and fall transitions. For 
example,
pin("IN1") {
  direction : input;
  capacitance : 0.0067542;
  rise_capacitance : 0.0123321;
  fall_capacitance : 0.0056745;
  rise_capacitance_range (0.0045670, 0.012345);
  fall_capacitance_range (0.005656, 0.0123123);
}
When the variable is set to true, the tool uses the worst-case capacitance values specified 
by the rise and fall range attributes (for example, the high value for late arrival timing and 
the low value for early arrival timing). When the variable is set to false, the tool uses the 
single value specified by the plain "capacitance" attribute and ignores the rise and fall 
capacitance attributes.

maintain route topology, it does not simultaneously reassign the net identity of the route 
metallization geometries associated with the net. Route preservation performs this task in 
a process executed after the optimization phase finishes and before ECO routing begins.

Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Group
none
Description
When this variable is set to false  (the default), the characterize  command will fail if used 
on a cell instance that contains a power domain belonging to a scope above that instance.
In order to characterize this sort of instance, this variable must be set to true. This will 
enable characterize  to change the scope of the subdomain to the scope of the instance 
being characterized.
Domains which have their scope changed in this manner are not eligible for later domain 
merging by propagate_constraints.
Examples
Consider a simple design with the domain partitioning scheme:
create_power_domain TOP -include_scope
create_power_domain MID -elements {x/y}
Normally, characterize of the instance x  is not permitted:
prompt> characterize x
Warning: Characterization of power supply data (UPF constraints, 
 operating_voltages, etc.) to hierarchical cell 'x' have been skipped. 
 (MV-116)
Reason: a descendent cell 'x/y' of 'x' belongs to a power domain 'MID' 
 whose scope is above 'w'.
Error: Characterize failed. (CHR-002)
0
When the variable is set to true, the operation succeeds and the domain is re-scoped:
prompt> set upf_charz_enable_domain_rescoping true
true
prompt> characterize x
Information: The power domain 'MID' has a scope above 'x'. The scope of 
 the domain will be changed in the subdesign.

Description
This variable prevents non-GTECH cells from being remapped during the incremental 
behavior of the insert_mv_cells command. The tool can ignore an isolation cell instance if 
it’s mapped to a valid isolation library cell. A valid isolation library cell:
- Complies with any restrictions related to the isolation strategy that references it. For 
example, restrictions set by the map_isolation_cell command or NOR-style isolation 
requirements
- Hass to match the design operating conditions of the referenced isolation cell.
The tool does not require the isolation cell match any other constraints such as target 
library subset or link library subset constraints. The tool does not perform conversions, 
such as isolation cell to enable level-shifter cell, if the isolation cell is mapped to a valid 
isolation library cell. This means that if there is a voltage violation, it is left unresolved.
To determine or change the current value of this variable, use get_app_var or 
set_app_var, respectively.

upf_infer_complex_retention_cells
Controls inference of complex retention cells in place of complex non-retention cells

A cell is considered complex if it does not have a valid functionality.
Data Types
Boolean
Description
When this variable is set to false  (the default), tool will not infer any complex retention cells 
in place of pre-instantiated complex non-retention cells. The pre-instantiated complex non-
retention cells will be left as is in the final netlist.
When this variable is set to true, tool will infer complex retention cells in place of pre-
instaniated complex non-retention cells having retention strategies. This style of inference 
will be supported both in compile_ultra  and compile_ultra -incremental.

Tool will try to infer a complex retention cell during compile_ultra  based on pin name 
matching. Here are the steps that will be performed by the tool during compile_ultra:
1. Pin names of the non-retention cell will be matched with the pin names of the retention 
library cells specified in the map_retention_cell  command.
2. The first retention library cell whose pin names exactly match (barring the retention 
save/restore pins) will be picked up and swapped in place of the non-retention cell.
3. If a matching retention library cell is not found, then a warning message will be printed 
saying that the non-retention cell cannot be converted to retention.
With the pin name matching approach, the tool will pick up the first matching retention 
library cell from the map_retention_cell  command. If there are multiple matches available 
in map_retention_cell, and if the user wants a particular retention library cell to be picked 
up among the matches, then users will be able to achieve this by setting a new attribute 
called retention_equivalent  on the non-retention library cell. The value of this attribute will 
be the name of the preferred (equivalent) retention library cell.
Usage -
 
        set_attribute {library/non_retention_library_cell_name} 
 retention_equivalent {retention_library_cell_name}
      
If the retention library cell (specified as the attribute value) is invalid, then the tool will fall 
back to the pin name matching approach. A retention library cell will be considered invalid 
in the following scenarios:
1. The retention library cell is not present in any of the target libraries.
2. The retention library cell has the dont_use attribute on it.
3. The retention library cell does not have the retention_cell  attribute on it.
4. The retention library cell is not present as one of the library cells in the 
map_retention_cell  command.
5. The non-retention library cell has at least one pin that is not present on the retention 
library cell.
So, if an invalid retention library cell is found as the attribute value, then the tool will not 
honor the retention_equivalent  attribute, and it will fall back to the pin name matching 
approach.
Point # 5 means that all the pins present on the non-retention library cell must also be 
present on the retention library cell. But it is okay for the retention library cell to have 
additional pins (other than the retention save/restore pins). Examples for additional pins 
are scan input and scan enable pins. If a retention library cell having additional pins is

inferred by the tool, then compile_ultra  will connect the additional pins to constant zero. 
If a particular pin is not supposed to be connected to constant zero, then the user is 
expected to fix the connection after compile_ultra  (before taking the netlist further down 
the flow). Whenever a retention library cell having additional pins is inferred, a message 
will be printed to let the users know about such an inference. This should help the users 
to watch out for the connections made by the tool to the additional pins. Inferring retention 
cells with additional pins will be helpful for users who want to replace a non-scan non-
retention cell (instantiated in the RTL) with a scan retention cell. insert_dft can later do the 
required scan stitching with the scan input/scan enable pins.
Handling mismatching pin names: Users may have library cells where certain pin names 
of the non-retention library cell do not match the pin names of the retention library cell. 
In such cases, users can use the same retention_equivalent  attribute to specify the pin 
mappings between the mismatching pin names.
Usage -
 
        set_attribute {library/non_retention_library_cell_name} 
 retention_equivalent {retention_library_cell_name {pin1 pin2} {pin3 
 pin4}}
      
In this usage, the attribute value has the retention library cell name listed first and then 
the pin mappings between the non-retention library cell and the retention library cell. The 
above usage means that:
1. pin1  on the non-retention library cell corresponds to (or is equivalent to) pin2  on the 
retention library cell.
2. pin3  on the non-retention library cell corresponds to pin4  on the retention library cell.
This information will help the implementation tools to transfer the net connections 
appropriately. If the pin mappings are invalid, then the tool will fall back to the pin name 
matching approach. Pin mappings will be considered invalid in the following scenarios:
1. The specified pin name does not exist on the non-retention library cell/retention library 
cell.
2. Other than the specified pin mappings, the non-retention library cell has at least one 
pin that is not present on the retention library cell.

This variable controls the library cells used to map regular isolation cells when a 
mapping constraint has been specified to map zero-pin retention clamp cells with

There are three legal values this variable can be set to - "true", "false", "nor". The default 
value is false, which allows library cells specified in map_retention_clamp_cell command 
to be used to map regular isolation cells. When this variable is set to true, tool will not 
pick library cells used in map_retention_clamp_cell to map regular isolation cells. When 
this variable is set to nor, tool will only exclude NOR isolation library cells specified in 
map_retention_clamp_cell command when mapping regular isolation cells. However, 
if a library cell is specified with both map_retention_clamp_cell  and map_isolation_cell 
command, map_isolation_cell  gets higher precedence, and the library cell can still be used 
to map regular isolation cells of the isolation strategy. Global control does not play any role 
in this scenario.
If the design has regular isolation cells mapped to a library cell mentioned in 
fBmap_retention_clamp_cell  command, the next mapping command will remap this cell to 
a library cell not specified as part of map_retention_clamp_cell  command.

Description
This variable specifies the name of the mapping file to be used for each design during 
reapplication of golden UPF to the designs. The variable can specify a single design 
name and its corresponding map file, or it can list multiple pairs of design names and 
corresponding map file names.
For example, to set a single design name and map name:
prompt> set upf_name_map [list {my_design my_design.map}]
To set multiple designs and corresponding map names:
prompt> set upf_name_map [list {top top.map} \\
        {mid mid.map}]
In a golden UPF session, the tool can change object names as a result of ungrouping 
and expansion of wildcard names to full names. When the golden UPF and supplemental 
UPF are applied to a design in a later tool session, the object names used in the golden 
UPF file must be properly mapped to the new names used in the design netlist. Synopsys 
Galaxy flow tools all use the same renaming conventions to keep track of changed names.
However, the default renaming conventions cannot handle some complex renaming 
situations. In those cases, the write -format verilog  command, in addition to writing out the 
Verilog netlist, also writes an explicit name mapping file containing the renaming rules for 
the specific design. It also inserts a link to the name mapping file into the Verilog netlist, in 
the form of a pragma statement.
In a later tool session, when you read in this Verilog netlist, the tool automatically finds the 
applicable name map file and properly maps the object names, and it is not necessary to 
set the upf_name_map  variable. However, if the name map file has been moved to a new 
location, or if the Verilog file no longer contains the pragma statement, you can set this 
variable to specify the location of the name mapping file. The variable setting overrides 
any conflicting location specified by a pragma in the Verilog netlist file.

To map the power management cells, tool abides by both UPF constraints

target_library_subset libcells, tool leaves the power management cells unmapped or 
level shifter violations unaddressed. Thus, setting the variable will help relaxing the 
set_target_library_subset constraint and use only UPF constraint during mapping. This 
helps avoiding unmapped power management cells. Currently, the variable takes effect 
only for isolation, level shifter and enable level shifter cells.
Examples

 are, ISO_1, CKISO

With the variable set to false, tool will not consider libcell
CKISO for isolation mapping as it is marked as dont_use via

verifies that the existing isolation cell satisfies all of the parameters of the isolation 
strategy, except the power and ground nets. If these parameters are satisfied, the tool 
uses the existing cell and does not create another isolation cell for the port.
Set this variable to true  if you want occurrences of this condition to be reported as 
UPF-073 information messages.

Description
When this variable is set to false  (the default), tool does not analyze pin precedence of 
library cells. In this mode, sequential output inversion is enabled on cells having retention 
strategies.
When this variable is set to true, tool analyzes pin precedence of library cells. If both set 
dominant/reset dominant and restore dominant retention library cells are found, then the 
tool disables sequential output inversion on cells having retention strategies. This is to 
make sure that a set/reset dominant library cell is not converted to a restore dominant 
library cell (or vice-versa) through sequential output inversion, as such a transformation 
can result in a verification failure.

Description
When this variable is set to true  (the default), enable level shifters inserted by the tool can 
use a power supply that is either equally always-on or more always-on than the supply for 
the driver of the inputs of the enable level shifter.
When this variable is set to false, enable level shifters inserted by the tool must use a 
power supply that is equally always-on compared to the supply for the driver of the inputs 
of the enable level shifter.
An enable level shifter is a power management cell that performs both isolation and level 
shifting between two power domains.

Default VECTOR
Description
The vhdlout_preserve_hierarchical_types  variable affects the way in which the write -f vhdl 
command writes out ports on lower-level designs. A lower-level design is instantiated by 
any of the designs being written out. Another variable, vhdlout_single_bit, controls ports on 
top-level designs.
Valid values are as follows:
USER
All ports on lower-level designs are written with their original data types. The 
value of USER  affects only designs that are read in VHDL format.
VECTOR
All ports on lower-level designs are written with their ports bused, which means 
that ports keep their names and are not bit-blasted. The ports are written 
with the type defined by vhdlout_bit_vector_type  or, for single-bit ports, by 
vhdlout_bit_type. This setting of VECTOR  (the default value) often results 
in the most efficient description for simulation. Bus ranges are always in 
ascending order, beginning with 0, regardless of the range description in the 
original VHDL. If you use VECTOR, you must ensure that the value of the 
vhdlout_bit_vector_type  variable is an array type whose elements are defined by 
the vhdlout_bit_type  variable.
BIT
All typed ports are bit-blasted, which means that a port that is n  bits wide is 
written to the VHDL file as n  separate ports. Each port is given a type as defined 
by the vhdlout_bit_type  variable.
Note that if vhdlout_single_bit  = BIT, the tool ignores vhdlout_preserve_hierarchical_types 
and writes out the entire design hierarchy as bit-blasted. Also, 
vhdlout_preserve_hierarchical_types  cannot take on a higher value than the current 
value defined for the vhdlout_single_bit  variable. The descending order is USER, 
VECTOR, and BIT. Thus, the combination vhdlout_single_bit  = VECTOR  and 
vhdlout_preserve_hierarchical_types  = USER  is not possible.
Also note that if vhdlout_follow_vector_direction  = true, the type mode is automatically set 
to VECTOR.

vhdlout_separate_scan_in
Affects the way in which the write -f vhdl  command writes out the scan chain in VHDL.
Data Types
string
Default false
Description
The vhdlout_separate_scan_in  variable affects the way in which the write -f vhdl  command 
writes out the scan chain in VHDL.
By default, the tool writes out the scan chain in the same file as the design. The scan 
chain is not visible in the testbench, and, therefore, parallel loading is not possible.
When the value is set to true, the tool writes out the scan chain as a package to a 
separate file. The design must be written out in a single hierarchical file, and it must 
contain the scan-chain package, before simulation or synthesis takes place.
You receive a message only when the scan-chain package is written successfully. 
Otherwise, no message appears.

Valid values are as follows:
USER
All ports on the top-level design are written out with their original data types. The 
USER  value affects only designs that are read in VHDL format.
VECTOR
All ports on the top-level design are written with their ports bused, which means 
that ports keep their names and are not bit-blasted. The ports are written with 
the type defined by the vhdlout_bit_vector_type  variable, or for single-bit ports, 
the vhdlout_bit_type  variable. Lower-level design ports are controlled by the 
vhdlout_preserve_hierarchical_types  variable. (A design is lower-level if it is 
instantiated by any of the designs being written out.)
Bus ranges are always in ascending order, beginning with 0, regardless of the 
range description in the original VHDL. If you use VECTOR, you must ensure 
that the value of the vhdlout_bit_vector_type  variable is an array type whose 
elements are defined by the vhdlout_bit_type  variable.
BIT
All typed ports are bit-blasted, which means that a port that is n  bits wide is 
written to the VHDL file as n  separate ports. Each port is given a type, as 
defined by the vhdlout_bit_type  variable.
Note that if vhdlout_follow_vector_direction  = true, the type mode is automatically set to 
VECTOR.

command, and library clauses are not written out.
The process by which each package is printed out depends on the number of dots (.) in 
the package name, as follows:
• No dots prepends "work." and appends ".all" to the name.
 
 
• One dot appends ".all" to the name.
 
 
• Two dots simply prints the package name.

vhdlout_write_top_configuration
Instructs the write -format vhdl  command to write out a configuration statement, if 
necessary, such as when ports on the top-level design are written as vectors instead of 
user types.
Data Types
Boolean
Default false
Description
The vhdlout_write_top_configuration  variable to instructs the write -format vhdl  command 
to write out a configuration statement, if necessary, such as when ports on the top-level 
design are written as vectors instead of user types. The port map of the configuration 
statement contains calls to type conversion functions.
For more information, see the man pages for the vhdlout_single_bit  and 
vhdlout_preserve_hierarchical_types  variables.
By default, the tool does not write out a configuration statement.
The configuration statement binds the (written out) top-level design to an entity and 
architecture outside of the .db file. The outside architecture is assumed to instantiate as a 
component the written top-level design. An example of an outside architecture is a user-
supplied testbench that drives simulation with test vectors.
For example, if the testbench uses user types, but the top-level design's ports are 
written as vectors, the ports do not interface to the testbench directly because of type 
mismatches. The use of type conversions in the configuration statement solves this 
problem. The write -format vhdl  command does not write a configuration statement for bit-
blasted designs.
Inout ports cannot be handled by conversion functions, because there is no way of 
determining whether to convert for a sink (output) or for a source (input). When write 
-format vhdl  encounters an inout port, it checks the netlist. If the port functions as a true 
bidirectional signal, the tool issues error message VHDL-17. If the inout port functions only 
as a sink or as a source, write -format vhdl  creates the correct type conversion.
You can use this variable with the vhdlout_write_architecture  and vhdlout_write_entity 
variables to control the information write -format vhdl  writes out.

special regular expression meaning. See the EXAMPLES section for more information.
Escaping Escape Character (\\\\)
This is similar to that of escaping wildcard characters, but needs one escape character 
each to escape the escape character. See the EXAMPLES section for more information.
Examples
The following are examples of using wildcard characters.
Using Wildcards
The following example gets all nets in the current design that are prefixed by in and 
followed by any two characters:
prompt> get_nets in??
{"in11" "in21"}
The following example gets all cells in the current design that are prefixed by U and 
followed by a string of characters of any length:

write_test_max_cycles
Controls the automatic partitioning of long test sets across multiple files by specifying the

Data Types
integer
Default 0
Description
This variable controls the automatic partitioning of long test sets across multiple files by 
specifying the maximum number of tester cycles any one vector file can contain. One 
tester cycle corresponds to one cycle of parallel (nonshift) operation of the device under 
test or to the shifting of scan data one bit in the scan chains.
Each vector file is self-contained; that is, the vectors within a specific file are independent 
of the state of the device under test and specifically do not require the vectors in other 
files to have been previously applied. This implies that write_test_max_cycles  is used 
only for full-scan designs, and that test sets are not partitioned for partial scan designs. 
Additionally, the partitioning of the vector set has no effect on fault coverage.

write_test_max_scan_patterns
Controls the automatic partitioning of long test sets across multiple files, by specifying the

Data Types
integer
Default 0
Description
This variable controls the automatic partitioning of long test sets across multiple files, by 
specifying the maximum number of scan test patterns any one vector file can contain. 
The application of a scan test pattern encompasses the serial loading and unloading of 
the scan chains and consumes many tester cycles. Typically this correlates directly to the 
number of scan test patterns the create_test_patterns  command generates. For designs 
with multiple system clocks, however, it might be necessary to repeat a number of times 
the application of each scan test pattern.
Each vector file is self-contained; that is, the vectors within a specific file are independent 
of the state of the device under test and do not require the vectors in other files to have 
been previously applied. This implies that write_test_max_scan_patterns  is used only 
for full-scan designs, and that test sets are not partitioned for partial-scan designs. 
Additionally, the partitioning of the vector set has no effect on fault coverage for full-scan 
designs.
By default, this variable is set to 0, which implies there are no limits. Thus, automatic file 
partitioning is not performed. Work with your ASIC vendors to determine an appropriate 
value. Setting this variable to any value less than 2 results in no file partitioning.

a
acs_compile_attributes
Customizes the Automated Chip Synthesis compile strategy.
Description
Automated Chip Synthesis provides attributes that can customize the compile strategy. To 
set these attributes, use the set_attribute  command to set the attribute on the reference 
design for the compile partition (or on the top-level design).
Each chip-level compile command (acs_compile_design, acs_refine_design, and 
acs_recompile_design) performs a two-step compile. The acs_compile_design and 
acs_recompile_design commands perform a full compile followed by a boundary compile. 
The acs_refine_design command performs an incremental compile followed by a 
boundary compile. The Automated Chip Synthesis compile attributes control both the effort 
and the strategy used in each of the steps.
These attributes affect the compile scripts generated by the write_compile_script 
command (and therefore the compile scripts generated by the chip-level compile 
commands). Some attributes add commands to the script before the compile command; 
others modify the compile command options.
Automated Chip Synthesis ignores these compile attributes if a custom compile strategy or 
custom compile script exists in the directory defined for the user_compile_strategy_script 
or user_override_script directories (default directory is $acs_work_dir/scripts/dest_dir).
The following attributes control the effort used in each compile step (full, incremental, and 
boundary):
• FullCompile
Valid values are none, low, medium, and high.
Default value is medium.

wire_load_model_mode
Determines which wire load model to use to compute wire capacitance, 
resistance, and area for nets in a hierarchical design that has different wire 
load models at different hierarchical levels. Allowed values are top, use the wire 
load model at the top hierarchical level; enclosed, use the wire load model on 
the smallest design that encloses a net completely; and segmented, break the 
net into segments, one within each hierarchical level. In the segmented  mode, 
each net segment is estimated using the wire load model on the design that 
encloses that segment. The segmented  mode is not supported for wire load 
models on clusters. If a value is not specified for this attribute, compile  searches

There are a number of commands used to set attributes; however, most attributes can be 
set with the set_attribute  command. If the attribute definition specifies a set  command, 
use it to set the attribute. Otherwise, use the set_attribute  command. If an attribute is read 
only, it cannot be set by the user.
To determine the value of an attribute, use the get_attribute  command. To remove 
attributes, use the remove_attribute  command.
For a detailed information of an attribute, see the man pages of the appropriate set 
command. For information on all attributes, see the attributes  man page.
Pin Attributes
bus_name
If the pin is bussed, returns the full hierarchical name of the pin bus. This 
attribute is read only  and cannot be set by the user.
clock
The clock attribute indicates whether an input pin is a clock pin.
 
                clock : true | false
              
The true  value specifies the pin as a clock pin. The false  value specifies the pin 
as not a clock pin, even though it might have the clock characteristics.
The following example defines pin CLK2 as a clock pin.
pin(CLK2) {
  direction : input ;

port_attributes
Contains attributes that can be placed on a port.
Description
Contains attributes that can be placed on a port.
There are a number of commands used to set attributes. Most attributes, however, can be 
set with the set_attribute  command. If the attribute definition specifies a set  command, use 
it to set the attribute. Otherwise, use set_attribute. If an attribute is "read-only," the user 
cannot set it.
To determine the value of an attribute, use the get_attribute  command. To remove 
attributes, use the remove_attribute  command.
For a more detailed explanation of an attribute, refer to the manual pages of the 
appropriate set  command. For information on all attributes, refer to the attributes  manual 
page.
Port Attributes
bus_name
If the port is bussed, returns the full hierarchical name of the port bus. This 
attribute is read only  and cannot be set by the user.
connection_class
A string that specifies the connection class label to be attached to a port or 
to a list of ports. compile, insert_pads, and insert_dft  will connect only those 
loads and drivers that have the same connection class label. The labels must 
match those in the library of components for the design, and must be separated 
by a space. The labels universal  and default  are reserve.d universal  indicates 
that the port can connect with any other load or driver. default  is assigned 
to any ports that do not have a connection class already assigned. Set with 
set_connection_class.
