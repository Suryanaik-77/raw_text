cache_ls
Lists elements in a Synopsys cache.
Syntax
cache_ls  cache_dir reg_expr
string cache_dir
string reg_expr
Arguments
cache_dir
Specifies a UNIX pathname to the cache directory to be searched. The 
pathname should end with the directory component "synopsys_cache".
reg_expr
Specifies a regular expression to be used to match the pathname of each cache 
element that is to be listed. The regular expression is the type accepted by the 
UNIX egrep command.
Description
From the directory cache_dir, this command lists the cache elements whose pathname (as 
opposed to the filename) matches the expression reg_expr. The command is translated 
into the following UNIX command:
find cache_dir  -type f -exec ck_path.sh {} reg_expr  \; -print
As an aside, an easy way to get all the cache elements is the UNIX command "ls -R".
Examples
In this example, all of the cache elements with "add" in their pathname are listed:
% cache_ls  ~/synopsys_cache add

cache_rm
Removes elements from a Synopsys cache.
Syntax
cache_rm  cache_dir reg_expr
string cache_dir
string reg_expr
Arguments
cache_dir
Specifies a UNIX pathname to a cache directory. The pathname should end with 
the directory component "synopsys_cache".
reg_expr
Specifies a regular expression to be used to match the pathname of each cache 
element that is to be removed. The regular expression is the type accepted by 
the UNIX egrep command.
Description
From the directory cache_dir, this command removes the cache elements whose 
pathname (as opposed to the filename) matches the expression reg_expr. The command 
is translated into the following UNIX command:
find cache_dir  -type f -exec ck_path.sh {} reg_expr  \; -print -exec rm {} 
 \;
As an aside, an easy way to remove the entire cache directory is the UNIX command "rm 
-r".
Examples
In this example, all of the cache elements with "add" in their pathname are removed:

string lib
string logfile
list file_list
Arguments
-nc
Indicates that the initial copyright banner message is to be turned off.

(.synopsys_vss.setup).
-v
Indicates that create_types  is to display program version information and then 
exit.
-o logfile
Specifies the name of a log file to which messages sent to the standard output 
are to be redirected. Use this option if you are running create_types  in batch 
mode, or if you do not wish messages to be displayed during execution of 
create_types.
file_list
Specifies the name(s) of one or more VHDL package files from which type 
information is to be extracted. Typically these files have the extension .vhd  or 
.vhdl.

Chapter 1: Synthesis Tool Invocation Commands
create_types
Feedback
Description
Extracts type information from VHDL package files that contain user-defined VHDL types. 
For each package contained in the input VHDL file(s), create_types  creates a package.typ 
file. Creating the package.typ  file isolates the type information and makes it available 
to other utilities (for example, dc_shell  (analyze  or read); vhdlan; and DesignSource.) 
create_types  places the .typ  files in the design library mapped to the logical name WORK. 
To override the mapping in the user option file (.synopsys_vss.setup), use the -w  lib 
option.
NOTE:  Before running create_types  on your VHDL package, you must have already run 
analyze, read, or vhdlan  on the package.
The type information contained in a .typ  file is used by Synopsys synthesis and simulation 
tools when analyzing designs that use the user-defined types defined in the corresponding 
package. You must create .typ  files to analyze designs or DesignWare components that 
use VHDL types not defined in STD.STANDARD. Notice that type information is used 
hierarchically. That is, if you analyze a high-level package that references user-defined 
types from lower-level packages, .typ  files must exist for the lower-level packages.
The type information in .typ  files is used also by Synopsys's DesignSource tools to perform 
type resolution and checking and to permit interactive type selection. You must create a 
.typ  file in order for DesignSource to be aware of the user-defined types contained in a 
package.
FILES
$SYNOPSYS/admin/setup/.synopsys_vss.setup
The first setup file create_types  reads. This file contains the default setup.
$HOME/.synopsys_vss.setup
The second setup file create_types  reads. Settings in this file override those in 
$SYNOPSYS/admin/setup/.synopsys_vss.setup.
./.synopsys_vss.setup
The last setup file create_types  reads. Settings in this file override those in 
$HOME/.synopsys_vss.setup.
filename  .vhd
The VHDL package file that defines the user-defined types.
package  .typ
The analyzed file that contains information about the user-defined types 
contained in package. These files are similar to the .syn  and .sim  files produced 
by VHDL Analyzer.

dc_shell
Data Types

--- TABLE (Page 9) ---
script_file | string
command_string | string
feature_list | list
timeout_value | integer
Executes script_file (a file of dc_shell commands) before displaying the initial
dc_shell prompt. If the last statement in script_file is quit, no prompt is displayed
and the command shell is exited.
-x command_string
Executes the dc_shell statement in command_string before displaying the initial
dc_shell prompt. Multiple statements can be entered. Separate the statements
with semicolons and enclose each statement with quotation marks around
the entire set of command statements after the -X option. If the last statement
entered is quit, no prompt is displayed and the command shell is exited.
-minimize_peak_mem
Balances memory peaks with runtime by restricting the use of transparent huge
pages during compile. If your kernel is below 3.15, transparent huge pages
will not be reenabled after compile, which can have a greater runtime impact.
-minimize_peak_mem only works on systems with kernel 3.1 or above.
-no_init
Specifies that dc_shell is not to execute any .synopsys_dc.setup startup files.
This option is only used when you want to include a command log or other
script file in order to reproduce a previous Design Analyzer or dc_shell session.
Include the script file either by using the -f option or by issuing the include
command from within dc_shell.
-no_home_init
Specifies that dc_shell is not to execute any home synopsys_dc.setup startup
files.
-no_local_init
Specifies that dc_shell is not to execute any local synopsys_dc.setup startup
files.
-checkout feature_list
Specifies a list of licensed features to check out in addition to the default
features checked out by the program.

-wait wait_time
Specifies the maximum wait time (in minutes), that dc_shell waits to check out 
the licensed features specified by the -checkout  option. You can invoke dc_shell 
successfully only when all of the licensed features specified with the -checkout 
feature_list  option can be checked out during the specified wait time.
-timeout timeout_value
Specifies a value from 5 to 20 that indicates the number of minutes the program 
spends trying to recover a lost contact with the license server before terminating. 
The default is 10 minutes.
-version
Displays the version number, build date, site id number, local administrator, and 
contact information, and then exits.
-64bit
Invokes the 64-bit executable of the Design Compiler command shell.
-output_log_file
Specifies a file to which the tool's console output is to be logged. Using this 
option causes the variable sh_output_log_file  to be set and output logging is 
performed exactly as described in the man page for that variable.
-no_log
Disables command file logging for the session and creates a filenames log file 
such as:
<filename>_<pid>_<timestamp>.log.
-topographical
Enables Design Compiler topographical mode.
-container
Enables Design Compiler Container - a way to bundle all application system 
dependencies into a single package so that it can run on any host that supports 
the container engine regardless of what packages are installed on the host 
(needed for cloud computing).
Description
The dc_shell  command interprets and executes Design Compiler and DFT Compiler 
commands. Design Compiler and DFT Compiler are Synopsys products that optimize 
logic. The dc_shell environment consists of user commands and variables that control the 
synthesis and optimization capabilities of Design Compiler and DFT Compiler.

Chapter 1: Synthesis Tool Invocation Commands
dc_shell
Feedback
The dc_shell command executes commands until it is terminated by a quit  or exit 
command. During interactive mode, you can also terminate the dc_shell session by 
pressing Control-d.
To cancel or interrupt the command currently executing in dc_shell, press Control-c. The 
time it takes for a command to process an interrupt depends upon the size of the design 
and the command. If you press Control-c 3 times before a command responds to the 
interrupt, dc_shell exits and the following message is displayed:
Information: Process terminated by interrupt.
There are 3 types of statements in dc_shell: assignment, control, and command.
There are 7 types of expressions: string, numeric, constant, variable, list, command, 
operator, and complex.
Statements and expressions are discussed in detail in the following subsections.
Special Characters
The pipe character ( | ) has no meaning in dc_shell. Use backslash e ( \\e ) to escape 
double quotes when executing a UNIX command. For example, the following command 
requires backslash characters before the double quotes to prevent Design Compiler from 
ending the command prematurely:
dc_shell> sh \'grep \\'foo\\' my_file\'
Assignment Statements
An assignment statement assigns the value of the expression on the right side of an equal 
sign to the variable named on the left side of the equal sign.
The syntax of an assignment statement is as follows:
variable_name = expression
The following are examples of dc_shell assignment statements:
dc_shell> hlo_ignore_priorities = "false" 
 
dc_shell> text_threshold = 6
The following are examples of dc_shell assignment statements for float numbers:
dc_shell> my_float = 100.3
100.300003
 
dc_shell> my_another_float = 123456700.0
123456704.000000
The dc_shell environment uses 32 bit IEEE format to represent floating point numbers. 
This format cannot represent all numbers exactly, so the returned number may not always

be the number originally specified. Typically, only the first 6 or 7 digits are precisely 
represented. Beyond that, there can be some variance.
Control Statements
The if  and while  control statements allow conditional execution and looping in dc_shell 
language. The syntax of the basic if  statement is as follows:
if ( condition ) {
statement_list
}
Other forms of the if  statement allow the use of else  and else if.
The syntax of the while  statement is as follows:
while ( condition ) {
statement_list
}
For a discussion of relational and logical operators used in the control statements, see the 
Operator Expressions  and Complex Expressions  sections of this man page.
Command Statements
The dc_shell invokes the specified command with its arguments. The following example 
show the syntax of a command statement:
command_name argument_1 argument_2 ... argument_n
Arguments are separated by commas or spaces and can be enclosed in parentheses. The 
following are examples of dc_shell command statements:
dc_shell> set_max_delay 0 "OUT_PIN_1"
 
dc_shell> create_schematic ("-size", "A", "-hierarchy")
 
dc_shell> compile
String Expressions
A string expression is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks (""). The 
following are examples of string expressions:
"my_design_name"
 
"~/dir_1/dir_1/file_name"
 
"this is a string"

Numeric Constant Expressions
Numeric constant expressions are numeric values. They must begin with a digit and 
can contain a decimal point; a leading sign can also be included. Exponential notation is 
recognized. The following are examples of numeric constant expressions:
123
 
-234.5
 
123.4e56
Variable Expressions
A variable expression recalls the value of a previously-defined variable. Variable names 
can contain letters, digits, and most punctuation characters, but cannot start with a digit. 
The following are examples of variable expressions:
current_design
 
name/name
 
-all
 
+-*/.:'#~`%$&^@!_[]|?
If a variable used in an expression has not previously been assigned a value in an 
assignment statement, then its value is a string containing the variable name. The 
following two command statements are equivalent, assuming there is no variable defined 
with the -hierarchy  option:
dc_shell> create_schematic -hierarchy
 
dc_shell> create_schematic "-hierarchy"
This feature allows you to omit the quotes around many strings. For example, the following 
commands are equivalent, assuming there are no variables called "~user/dir/file", 
"equation", or "-f").
dc_shell> read "-f" "equation" "~user/dir/file"
 
dc_shell> read -f equation ~user/dir/file
List Expressions
A list expression defines a list constant. The list can include pathnames, cell names or pin 
names, values, etc. The syntax of a list expression is as follows:
{ expression_1 expression_2 ... expression_n }

Expressions are separated by spaces or commas. The following are examples of list 
expressions:
{}
 
{"pin_1" "pin_2" "pin_3"}
 
{1,2,3,4,5}
Command Expressions
A command expression invokes a dc_shell command and returns its value. The syntax 
of a command expression is the same as that of a command statement, except that 
parentheses are required in a command expression and are optional in a command 
statement. Commas separating arguments are optional for both. The following are 
examples of command expressions:
dc_shell> all_inputs( )
 
dc_shell> create_schematic ("-size" "a" "-hierarchy")
 
dc_shell> set_max_delay(0 "OUT_PIN_1")
Operator Expressions
Operator expressions perform simple arithmetic and string and list concatenation. The 
syntax of an operator expression is as follows:
expression operator  expression
The operator  is "+", "-", "*", or "/", and is separated by at least one preceding and one 
following space. Operator expressions involving numbers return the computed value. The 
"+" operator can be used with strings and lists to perform concatenation. The following are 
examples of operator expressions:
234.23 - 432.1
 
100 * scale
 
file_name_variable + ".suffix"
 
{portA, portB} + "portC"
The relational operators "==", "!=", ">", ">=", "<", and "<=" are used in the control 
statements if  and while. The greater than (>) operator should only be used in expressions 
with parentheses to avoid confusion with the file redirection operator ">".

The logical operators "&&", "||", and "!" (and, or, not) are also used in the if  and while 
control statements. The "not" operator is different from the other operators in that it is a 
unary operator with the following syntax:
! expression
Complex Expressions
Expressions can be built from other expressions, creating complex expressions. When 
a complex expression contains more than one operator, dc_shell satisfies multiplication 
and division operators before addition and subtraction. Simple expressions enclosed in 
parentheses take priority and override this rule. The expression "1 + 2 * 3 + 4" has the 
value 11, and "(1 + 2) * (3 + 4)" has the value 21.
The following is an example of an assignment  statement containing complex expressions:
dc_shell> my_variable = set_max_delay(23.2 * scaling_factor, \\ 
          all_outputs( ))
In this example, "my_variable" is assigned the value returned by the set_max_delay 
command expression. The set_max_delay  command is invoked with two arguments. The 
first argument is an operator expression that returns the value of the variable expression 
"scaling_factor" multiplied by the numeric constant expression "23.2". The second 
argument is a command expression that is equal to the value returned by the all_outputs 
command. The all_outputs  command is called with no arguments.
The following is an example of a complex command statement:
dc_shell> read -f edif ~user/dir/ + file_name
In this example, the read  command is called with 3 arguments. If you assume that "-f", 
"edif" and "~user/dir/" are not defined variables, and that file_name" is assigned the value 
my_design, then the first argument to the read  command is the string "-f". The second 
argument is the string "edif". The third argument is the concatenation of the string "~user/
dir/" with the string my_design. The third argument to the read  command is the string 
"~user/dir/my_file". The relational and logical operators can be used in combination to form 
complex conditions. The following are examples of complex conditional expressions:
(goal >= 7.34 || ! complete)
 
(a >= 7 || run_mode != "test" && !(error_detected == true))
 
(cycle < 4 && test == true || design_area > area_goal)
Complex logical expressions are evaluated from left to right, with "&&" being evaluated 
before "||". However, those expressions enclosed in parentheses are evaluated first.

Command Arguments
Many dc_shell commands have required or optional arguments that allow you to further 
define, limit, or expand the scope of their operation.
This man page contains a comprehensive list and description of these arguments. You can 
also use the help  command to view the man page online. For example, to view the online 
man page of the ungroup  command, enter the following command:
dc_shell> help ungroup
Many commands also offer a -help  option that lists the arguments available for that 
command. For example:
dc_shell> ungroup -help
Usage: ungroup
       <cell_list>
       -all
       -prefix
       -flatten
       -simple_names
Arguments that do not begin with a hyphen (-) are positional arguments. Positional 
arguments must be entered in a specific order. Non-positional arguments (those beginning 
with a hyphen) can be entered in any order and can be intermingled with positional 
arguments.
The names of non-positional arguments can be abbreviated to the minimum number of 
characters required to distinguish them from the other arguments.
The following commands are equivalent:
dc_shell> ungroup MODULAR -flatten -prefix MOD
 
dc_shell> ungroup -flatten -prefix MODULAR MOD
 
dc_shell> ungroup -f MODULAR -p MOD
Many arguments are optional, but if you omit a required argument, an error message and 
usage statement is displayed. For example:
dc_shell> group
Error: Argument '-design_name' required
Usage: group
        <cell_list>
        -except <cell_list>
        -design_name

Multiple Statement Lines and Multiple Line Statements
Normally, only one command is typed on a single line. To put more than one command on 
a line, must separate each command with a semicolon. For example:
dc_shell> read -f equation my_file.eqn; set_max_area 0; compile; \\ 
               create_schematic; plot
There is no limit to the number of characters on a dc_shell command line, but you 
can break a long command into multiple lines by terminating all but the last line with a 
backslash (\e). This tells dc_shell to expect the command to continue on the next line.
dc_shell> read -f equation\\ 
        {file_1, file_2, file_3,\\ 
        file_4, file_5, file_6}
This feature is normally used in files containing dc_shell commands (script files).
Output Redirection
The dc_shell allows you to divert command output messages to a file. To do this, type 
"> file_name" after any statement. The following example deletes the old contents of 
"my_file" and writes the output of the report_hierarchy  command to the file:
dc_shell> report_hierarchy > my_file
You can append the output of a command to a file with ">>". The following example 
appends the hierarchy report to the contents of my_file:
dc_shell> report_hierarchy >> my_file
Aliases
The alias  command gives you the ability to define new commands in terms of existing 
ones. You can reduce the number of keystrokes by defining short aliases for the 
commands and options you use most often.
The following example defines a new command called com  that is equivalent to running 
the compile  command with the -no_map  option.
dc_shell> alias com compile -no_map
With the com  alias defined, the following two commands are equivalent:
dc_shell> compile -no_map -verify
 
dc_shell> com -verify

dc_shell
Feedback
Alias definitions can be placed in your .synopsys_dc.setup file or in a separate file. The 
advantage of keeping aliases in a separate file is that all defined aliases can be written to 
a file with a command such as:
dc_shell> alias > ~/.synopsys_aliases
This works only if you put the command include ~/.synopsys_aliases  in 
your .synopsys_dc.setup file. The aliases are defined every time you start a new dc_shell 
session.
An alias is expanded only if it is the first token in a command, so aliases cannot be used 
as arguments to other commands.
History
A record is kept of all dc_shell commands issued during any given dc_shell session. The 
history  command displays a list of these commands.
dc_shell> history
     1  read -f equation my_design.eqn
 
     2  compile -no_map
 
     3  create_schematic
 
     ...
Your previous commands can be re-executed with the following "!" commands:
!!
Expands to the previous command.
!number
Expands to the command whose number in the history list matches number.
!-number
Expands to the command whose number in the history list matches the current 
command minus number.
!text
Expands to the most recent command that starts with text. A text  command 
can contain letters, digits, and underscores, and must begin with a letter or 
underscore.
!?text
Expands to the most recent command that contains text. A text  command 
can contain letters, digits, and underscores, and must begin with a letter or 
underscore.

Description
The de_shell  command interprets and executes DC Explorer commands. DC Explorer 
is a Synopsys product that optimize logic. The de_shell environment consists of user 
commands and variables that control the synthesis and optimization capabilities of DC 
Explorer.
The de_shell command executes commands until it is terminated by a quit  or exit 
command. During interactive mode, you can also terminate the de_shell session by 
pressing Control-d.
To cancel or interrupt the command currently executing in de_shell, press Control-c. The 
time it takes for a command to process an interrupt depends upon the size of the design 
and the command. If you press Control-c 3 times before a command responds to the 
interrupt, de_shell exits and the following message is displayed:
Information: Process terminated by interrupt.
There are 3 types of statements in de_shell: assignment, control, and command.
There are 7 types of expressions: string, numeric, constant, variable, list, command, 
operator, and complex.
Statements and expressions are discussed in detail in the following subsections.
Special Characters
The pipe character ( | ) has no meaning in de_shell. Use backslash e ( \\e ) to escape 
double quotes when executing a UNIX command. For example, the following command 
requires backslash characters before the double quotes to prevent DC Explorer from 
ending the command prematurely:
de_shell> sh \'grep \\'foo\\' my_file\'

Assignment Statements
An assignment statement assigns the value of the expression to the variable named in the 
set statement.
The syntax of an assignment statement is as follows:
set variable_name expression
The following are examples of de_shell assignment statements:
de_shell> set hlo_ignore_priorities false 
 
de_shell> set text_threshold 6
The following are examples of de_shell assignment statements for float numbers:
de_shell> set my_float 100.3
100.300003
 
de_shell> set my_another_float 123456700.0
123456704.000000
The de_shell environment uses 32 bit IEEE format to represent floating point numbers. 
This format cannot represent all numbers exactly, so the returned number may not always 
be the number originally specified. Typically, only the first 6 or 7 digits are precisely 
represented. Beyond that, there can be some variance.
Control Statements
The if  and while  control statements allow conditional execution and looping in de_shell 
language. The syntax of the basic if  statement is as follows:
if ( condition ) {
statement_list
}
Other forms of the if  statement allow the use of else  and else if.
The syntax of the while  statement is as follows:
while ( condition ) {
statement_list
}
For a discussion of relational and logical operators used in the control statements, see the 
Operator Expressions  and Complex Expressions  sections of this man page.

Command Statements
The de_shell invokes the specified command with its arguments. The following example 
show the syntax of a command statement:
command_name argument_1 argument_2 ... argument_n
Arguments are separated by commas or spaces and can be enclosed in parentheses. The 
following are examples of de_shell command statements:
de_shell> set_max_delay 0 "OUT_PIN_1"
 
de_shell> compile_exploration
String Expressions
A string expression is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks (""). The 
following are examples of string expressions:
"my_design_name"
 
"~/dir_1/dir_1/file_name"
 
"this is a string"
Numeric Constant Expressions
Numeric constant expressions are numeric values. They must begin with a digit and 
can contain a decimal point; a leading sign can also be included. Exponential notation is 
recognized. The following are examples of numeric constant expressions:
123
 
-234.5
 
123.4e56
Variable Expressions
A variable expression recalls the value of a previously-defined variable. Variable names 
can contain letters, digits, and most punctuation characters, but cannot start with a digit. 
The following are examples of variable expressions:
current_design
 
name/name
 
-all
 
+-*/.:'#~`%$&^@!_[]|?

Feedback
If a variable used in an expression has not previously been assigned a value in an 
assignment statement, then its value is a string containing the variable name. The 
following two command statements are equivalent, assuming there is no variable defined 
with the -hierarchy  option:
de_shell> write -hierarchy
 
de_shell> write "-hierarchy"
This feature allows you to omit the quotes around many strings. For example, the following 
commands are equivalent, assuming there are no variables called "~user/dir/file", 
"equation", or "-f").
de_shell> read "-f" "equation" "~user/dir/file"
 
de_shell> read -f equation ~user/dir/file
List Expressions
A list expression defines a list constant. The list can include pathnames, cell names or pin 
names, values, etc. The syntax of a list expression is as follows:
{ expression_1 expression_2 ... expression_n }
Expressions are separated by spaces or commas. The following are examples of list 
expressions:
{}
 
{"pin_1" "pin_2" "pin_3"}
 
{1,2,3,4,5}
Command Expressions
A command expression invokes a de_shell command and returns its value. The syntax 
of a command expression is the same as that of a command statement, except that 
parentheses are required in a command expression and are optional in a command 
statement. Commas separating arguments are optional for both. The following are 
examples of command expressions:
de_shell> all_inputs( )
 
de_shell> set_max_delay(0 "OUT_PIN_1")
Operator Expressions
Operator expressions perform simple arithmetic and string and list concatenation. The 
syntax of an operator expression is as follows:
expression operator  expression

----------- page number 26 -----------
Chapter 1: Synthesis Tool Invocation Commands
de_shell
Feedback
The operator  is "+", "-", "*", or "/", and is separated by at least one preceding and one 
following space. Operator expressions involving numbers return the computed value. The 
"+" operator can be used with strings and lists to perform concatenation. The following are 
examples of operator expressions:
234.23 - 432.1
 
100 * scale
 
file_name_variable + ".suffix"
 
{portA, portB} + "portC"
The relational operators "==", "!=", ">", ">=", "<", and "<=" are used in the control 
statements if  and while. The greater than (>) operator should only be used in expressions 
with parentheses to avoid confusion with the file redirection operator ">".
The logical operators "&&", "||", and "!" (and, or, not) are also used in the if  and while 
control statements. The "not" operator is different from the other operators in that it is a 
unary operator with the following syntax:
! expression
Complex Expressions
Expressions can be built from other expressions, creating complex expressions. When 
a complex expression contains more than one operator, de_shell satisfies multiplication 
and division operators before addition and subtraction. Simple expressions enclosed in 
parentheses take priority and override this rule. The expression "1 + 2 * 3 + 4" has the 
value 11, and "(1 + 2) * (3 + 4)" has the value 21.
The following is an example of an assignment  statement containing complex expressions:
de_shell> set my_variable [set_max_delay(23.2 * scaling_factor, \\ 
          all_outputs( ))]
In this example, "my_variable" is assigned the value returned by the set_max_delay 
command expression. The set_max_delay  command is invoked with two arguments. The 
first argument is an operator expression that returns the value of the variable expression 
"scaling_factor" multiplied by the numeric constant expression "23.2". The second 
argument is a command expression that is equal to the value returned by the all_outputs 
command. The all_outputs  command is called with no arguments.
The following is an example of a complex command statement:
de_shell> read -f edif ~user/dir/ + file_name
In this example, the read  command is called with 3 arguments. If you assume that "-f", 
"edif" and "~user/dir/" are not defined variables, and that file_name" is assigned the value 
my_design, then the first argument to the read  command is the string "-f". The second 
Synthesis Tool Invocation Commands

----------- page number 27 -----------
Feedback
Chapter 1: Synthesis Tool Invocation Commands
de_shell
argument is the string "edif". The third argument is the concatenation of the string "~user/
dir/" with the string my_design. The third argument to the read command is the string
"~user/dir/my_file". The relational and logical operators can be used in combination to form
complex conditions. The following are examples of complex conditional expressions:
(goal >= 7.34 || ! complete)
(a >= 7 || run_mode != "test" & & ! (error_detected == true))
(cycle < 4 & & test == true || design_area > area_goal)
Complex logical expressions are evaluated from left to right, with "&&" being evaluated
before "||". However, those expressions enclosed in parentheses are evaluated first.
Command Arguments
Many de_shell commands have required or optional arguments that allow you to further
define, limit, or expand the scope of their operation.
This man page contains a comprehensive list and description of these arguments. You can
also use the help command to view the man page online. For example, to view the online
man page of the ungroup command, enter the following command:
de_shell> help ungroup
Many commands also offer a -help option that lists the arguments available for that
command. For example:
de_shell> ungroup -help
# ungroup hierarchy
Usage: ungroup

--- TABLE (Page 27) ---
[-all] | (ungroup all cells)
[-prefix <prefix>] | (prefix to use in naming cells)
[-flatten] | (expand all levels of hierarchy)
[-simple_names] | (use simple, non-hierarchical names)
[-small <n>] | (ungroup all small hierarchy: Value >= 1)
[-force] | (ungroup dont touched cells as well)
[-soft] | (remove group_name attribute)
[-start_level <n>] | (flatten cells from level: Value >= 1)
[-all _instances] | (Ungroup all the instances of the cell)
[cell_list] | (list of cells to be ungrouped)
(Ungroup all the instances of the cell)
[cell_list]
(list of cells to be ungrouped)
Arguments that do not begin with a hyphen (-) are positional arguments. Positional
arguments must be entered in a specific order. Non-positional arguments (those beginning
with a hyphen) can be entered in any order and can be intermingled with positional
arguments.
The names of non-positional arguments can be abbreviated to the minimum number of
characters required to distinguish them from the other arguments.

Many arguments are optional, but if you omit a required argument, an error message is 
displayed. For example:
de_shell> group
Error: Current design is not defined. (UID-4)

Multiple Statement Lines and Multiple Line Statements
Normally, only one command is typed on a single line. To put more than one command on 
a line, must separate each command with a semicolon. For example:
de_shell> read -f equation my_file.eqn; set_max_area 0; 
 compile_exploration; \\ 
               report_constraint; report_timing
There is no limit to the number of characters on a de_shell command line, but you 
can break a long command into multiple lines by terminating all but the last line with a 
backslash (\e). This tells de_shell to expect the command to continue on the next line.
de_shell> read -f equation\\ 
        {file_1, file_2, file_3,\\ 
        file_4, file_5, file_6}
This feature is normally used in files containing de_shell commands (script files).
Output Redirection
The de_shell allows you to divert command output messages to a file. To do this, type 
"> file_name" after any statement. The following example deletes the old contents of 
"my_file" and writes the output of the report_hierarchy  command to the file:
de_shell> report_hierarchy > my_file
You can append the output of a command to a file with ">>". The following example 
appends the hierarchy report to the contents of my_file:
de_shell> report_hierarchy >> my_file
Aliases
The alias  command gives you the ability to define new commands in terms of existing 
ones. You can reduce the number of keystrokes by defining short aliases for the 
commands and options you use most often.

Feedback
The following example defines a new command called com  that is equivalent to running 
the compile_exploration  command with the -scan  option.
de_shell> alias com compile_exploration -scan
With the com  alias defined, the following two commands are equivalent:
de_shell> compile_exploration -scan -gate_clock
 
de_shell> com -gate_clock
Alias definitions can be placed in your .synopsys_dc.setup file or in a separate file. The 
advantage of keeping aliases in a separate file is that all defined aliases can be written to 
a file with a command such as:
de_shell> alias > ~/.synopsys_aliases
This works only if you put the command include ~/.synopsys_aliases  in 
your .synopsys_dc.setup file. The aliases are defined every time you start a new de_shell 
session.
An alias is expanded only if it is the first token in a command, so aliases cannot be used 
as arguments to other commands.
History
A record is kept of all de_shell commands issued during any given de_shell session. The 
history  command displays a list of these commands.
de_shell> history
     1  read -f verilog my_design.v
 
     2  compile_exploration -scan
 
     3  report_constraint
 
     ...
Your previous commands can be re-executed with the following "!" commands:
!!
Expands to the previous command.
!number
Expands to the command whose number in the history list matches number.
!-number
Expands to the command whose number in the history list matches the current 
command minus number.

The "+" operator can be used with strings and lists to perform concatenation. Following 
are examples of operator expressions: 234.23 - 432.1 100 * scale file_name_variable + 
".suffix" {portA, portB} + "portC"
The relational operators  "==", "!=", ">", ">=", "<", and "<=" are used in the control 
statements if  and while. The "greater than" operator ">" should only be used in 
parenthesized expressions to avoid confusion with the file redirection operator ">".
The logical operators  "&&", "||", and "!" (and, or, not) are also used in the control 
statements if  and while. The "not" operator is different from the other operators in that it is 
a unary operator with the syntax: ! expression
Complex Expressions
Expressions can be built from other expressions, creating complex expressions. When 
a complex expression contains more than one operator, lc_shell  satisfies multiplication 
and division operators before addition and subtraction. Simple expressions enclosed in 
parentheses are given priority and override this rule. Thus, the expression "1 + 2 * 3 + 4" 
has the value 11, and "(1 + 2) * (3 + 4)" has the value 21.
Following is an example of a complex command statement:
lc_shell> read -f edif ~user/dir/ + file_name
In this example, the read  command is called with three arguments. If we assume that "-
f", "edif" and "~user/dir/" are not defined variables, and that "file_name" was assigned the 
value "my_lib", then the first argument to the read  command is the string "-f". The second 
argument is the string "edif". The third argument is the concatenation of the string "~user/
dir/" with the string "my_lib". Thus, the third argument to the read  command is the string 
"~user/dir/my_file". The relational and logical operators can be used in combination to form 
complex conditions. Following are examples of complex conditional expressions:
(goal >= 7.34 || ! complete)
(a >= 7 || run_mode != "test" && !(error_detected == true))
Complex logical expressions are evaluated from left to right, with "&&" being evaluated 
before "||". However, those expressions enclosed in parentheses are evaluated first.
Command Arguments
Many lc_shell  commands have required or optional arguments that allow you to further 
define, limit or expand the scope of its operation.

lc_shell
Feedback
This manual contains a comprehensive list and description of these arguments. You can 
also use the help  command to view the manual page online. For example, to view the 
online manual page of the read_libn  command, enter: lc_shell> help read_lib
Many commands also offer a -help option that lists the arguments available for that 
command, for example:
lc_shell> read_lib -help
Usage: read_lib
        -format      (EDIF symbol format; default is Synopsys format)
        -symbol      (with EDIF, name of Synopsys library file to create)
        <file_name>  (technology or symbol library file)
        -no_warnings (disable warning messages)
Arguments that do not begin with a hyphen (-) are positional arguments. Positional 
arguments must be entered in a specific order relative to each other. Non-positional 
arguments (those beginning with a hyphen) can be entered in any order and can be 
intermingled with positional arguments.
The names of non-positional arguments can be abbreviated to the minimum number of 
characters required to distinguish them from the other arguments.
The following commands are equivalent: lc_shell> write_lib -format vhdl -output lib.vhd 
my_lib  lc_shell> write_lib my_lib -format vhdl -output lib.vhd my_lib  lc_shell> write_lib -f 
vhdl -o lib.vhd my_lib
Many arguments are optional, but if you omit a required argument, an error message and 
usage statement are displayed. For example:
lc_shell> read_lib
Error: Value required for the '<file_name>' argument. (EQN-19)
Usage: read_lib
        -format      (EDIF symbol format; default is Synopsys format)
        -symbol      (with EDIF, name of Synopsys library file to create)
        <file_name>  (technology or symbol library file)
        -no_warnings (disable warning messages)
Multiple Statement Lines and Multiple Line Statements
Normally, only one command is typed on a single line. If you want to put more than one 
command on a line, you must separate each command with a semicolon, for example:
lc_shell> read_lib my_lib.lib; report_lib my_lib; write_lib my_lib;
list -libraries; list -variables all
There is no limit to the number of characters on a lc_shell  command line, but you can 
break a long command into multiple lines by terminating all but the last line with a 
backslash (\e). This tells lc_shell  to expect the command to continue on the next line:
lc_shell> read -f edif\e

{file_1, file_2, file_3,\e
file_4, file_5, file_6}
This feature is normally used in files containing lc_shell  commands (script files).
Output Redirection
The lc_shell  lets you divert command output messages to a file. To do this, type "> 
file_name" after any statement. The following example deletes the old contents of 
"my_file" and writes the output of the report_lib  command to the file. lc_shell> report_lib 
my_lib1 > my_file
You can append the output of a command to a file with ">>". The following example 
appends the library report of my_lib2 to the contents of "my_file": lc_shell> report_lib 
my_lib2 >> my_file
Aliases
The alias  command gives you the ability to define new commands in terms of existing 
ones. You can reduce the number of keystrokes by defining short aliases for the 
commands and options you use most often.
The following example defines a new command "lc" that is equivalent to running the list 
command with the -variables option.
lc_shell> alias com list -variables
With the "lv" alias defined, the following two commands are equivalent:
lc_shell> list -variable vhdlio
lc_shell> lv vhdlio
Alias definitions can be placed in your .synopsys_lc.setup  file or in a separate file. The 
advantage of keeping aliases in a separate file is that all defined aliases can be written to 
a file with a command such as: lc_shell> alias > ~/.synopsys_aliases
If you put the command include ~/.synopsys_aliases  in your .synopsys_lc.setup  file, the 
aliases are defined every time you start a new lc_shell  session.
Note that aliases are only expanded if they are the first token in a command. Thus, they 
can not be used as arguments to other commands. See the description of the alias 
command in the Synopsys Commands  section of this manual.
History
A record is kept of all lc_shell  commands issued during any given lc_shell  session. The 
history  command displays a list of these commands. lc_shell> history  1 read_lib file.lib 2 
report_lib my_lib 3 write_lib my_lib ...

synenc
Runs the Synopsys Encryptor for HDL or Tcl source code.
Syntax
synenc  [-r synopsys_root] [-f format]
[-o file_path  | -ansi] [-zip]
file_list
 
synopsys_root       string
format              string
file_path           string
file_list           list
Arguments
-r synopsys_root
Specifies that synopsys_root  will be used as the UNIX path name where 
Synopsys tools are installed. If the -r  option is not specified, then the value of 
the SYNOPSYS environment variable is used as the path for the root directory. 
The Synopsys root directory is used to verify that the site has a DesignWare 
or DesignWare Developer license, which is required to run synenc. An error is 
issued if neither the -r  option nor the SYNOPSYS environment variable is set.
-f format
Specifies the format of the file to be encrypted. This is optional, because synenc 
can recognize the format of the source automatically. Use this option when you 
want to override the automatic recognition.
-o file_path
Specifies the path of the output file. synenc  saves the encrypted file to current 
working directory by default. If you want to save it to a different place, you can

use this option to specify that. The path can be either an absolute path or a 
relative path, but you must ensure that all directories in the path already exist. 
synenc  doesn't create any parent directory for the output file.
This option can only be used when there is one input file. It will be ignored when 
multiple input files are given.
This option can not be used with "-ansi" option at the same time.
-ansi
Specifies that all output files will be saved in the same directory as the input 
files. synenc  saves the encrypted file to current working directory by default. You 
can use this option to override the default behavior.
This option can not be used with "-o" option at the same time.
-zip
Specifies that the file will be compressed during encryption.
file_list
Specifies a list of files to encrypt. At least one file must be specified.
Description
The Synopsys Encryptor converts the HDL source of DesignWare parts or Tcl source to 
a form readable by Synopsys tools. Vendors protect the proprietary nature of the source 
files by encrypting them using synenc. Thus, customers who buy DesignWare parts from 
Synopsys or from a third-party vendor receive encrypted entities.
The synenc  command writes the encrypted output to files named file_name.e in the 
current directory by default. You can use different file name or path through "-o" option.
The synenc  command requires either a DesignWare Developer license or a DesignWare 
license. When the required license is not available, the command quits with an error 
message. To wait for licenses to become available if all licenses are in use, set the 
SNPSLMD_QUEUE environment variable to true before you start the synenc  command.
When you invoke the synenc  command, the tool displays the following message: 
Information: License queuing is enabled. (SYNENC-12) Use the SNPS_MAX_WAITTIME 
variable to specify the maximum wait time in seconds for the license. The default wait time 
is 8 hours.
Examples
In the following example, synenc  is used to encrypt the Verilog files add.v and add_fast.v, 
and store the output in the files add.v.e and add_fast.v.e in the current directory. The 
directory /usr/cad/synopsys is used as the root in verifying authorization.
% synenc -r /usr/cad/synopsys add.v add_fast.v
